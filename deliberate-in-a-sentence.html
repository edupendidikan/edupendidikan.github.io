                                            #Describe what is talked about in each paragraph from the above text.A mummy is a body, human or animal, whose skin and organs have been preserved by either intentional or incidental exposure to chemicals, extreme coldness (ice mummies), very low humidity, or lack of water when bodies are submerged in bogs, so that  the recovered body will not decay further if kept in cool and dry conditions.  Some authorities restrict the use of the term to bodies deliberately embalmed with chemicals, but the use of the word to cover accidentally desiccated bodies goes back at least to the 1730s.  Mummies of humans and other animals have been found throughout the world, both as a result of natural preservation through unusual conditions, and as cultural artefacts to preserve the dead.  At this context, the oldest known naturally mummified human corpse is a decapitated head dated as 6,000 years old, found in 1936 at the site named Inca Cueva No.  4 in South America on the other hand.  the oldest-known deliberate mummy is a child from the Camarones Valley in Chile, and dates from around 5050 BC., it belongs to Chinorro mummies, that are dating to thousands of years before the Egyptian mummies (perhaps the most known and famous  ).  Deliberate mummification is a feature of some ancient South American cultures in areas which, like Egypt, have very dry climates.  There are more than 1000 mummies in dry Xinjiang.  China.  Over one million animal mummies have been found in Egypt, many of which are cats.​</a>

The Quantum Learning Tenets
The first Tenet is "Everything Speaks." This concept reminds us that everything we do in the classroom sends a message to students. The way we greet students first thing in the morning or at the beginning of a class sends a message. The way we handle an incorrect response from a student given in front of peers sends a message. Our Environment, the Atmosphere we create, the Design of our lesson delivery or educational tasks, how we dress, the way we listen, or the character traits we model all send messages to our students. By being constantly aware of this important principle we tend to be more deliberate and proactive in orchestrating the messages students receive. This helps us better manage the variables that contribute to an optimal classroom atmosphere and learning environment.
"Everything is on Purpose" is the second Tenet and it follows logically from the one before it, "Everything Speaks." If everything speaks, then it follows that we want to be purposeful with everything we do in the classroom to get the desired outcome. A focus on the Tenet, "Everything is on Purpose", encourages a greater awareness of all the variables that influence learning. It is this Tenet that helps us to begin to see our role in the classroom differently. We are not in the classroom to dispense knowledge - we are there to orchestrate learning. We are striving to get masterful in this orchestration, and even small variables and details become important to us.
"Experience Before Label" is an important principle that influences our lesson design and delivery. It means that we involve students in an experience or elicit an experience that they can relate to before we attempt to attach it to any symbolic language or label. From a scientific perspective we are creating schema or a new neural network in the brain before attaching the label. It can also mean that we move the students to inquiry where they are seeking the label or concept before we give it to them. For example, a math teacher may involve students in a real-life situation in which they are trying to solve a problem but having difficulty based on what they already know. They may begin to look for a new formula or principle to help them accomplish the solution. This state of inquiry or searching would be an ideal time for the teacher to introduce the new concept, and this process would be called "Experience Before Label." In a literature class a teacher may have students experience writing from a talented author before introducing the literary concept of mood. A science teacher may have students experience or observe the laws of motion before actually labeling them.

The discover-defend axis
Ros is one of the most senior leaders in the UK’s state-run healthcare system. She oversees the complex web of relationships between the system’s many payers and providers and ensures that the interactions between the two help rather than hinder improvements in patient care. Budgets are tight and the outcomes of her team’s work are often subject to scrutiny by politicians and the media. So Ros has to help her colleagues stay energized and on their game as they pursue their noble goals, even when the going gets tough. Resilience is key.
The problem is, our brain is constantly looking for threats to fend off or rewards worth pursuing. When we’re more focused on threats than rewards, we’re in defensive mode. Our brain diverts some of its scarce mental energy into launching a ‘fight’, ‘flight,’ or ‘freeze’ response, and as those instinctive responses unfold—looking more like ‘snap, sulk, or skulk’ in the workplace—brain scans show less activity in the parts of the brain known as the prefrontal cortex. To put it another way: some of our more emotionally sophisticated neural machinery has gone offline.
This matters, because it takes surprisingly little to put someone’s brain into defensive mode—anything threatening a person’s self-worth, even the smallest social slight. This can create vicious circles in the workplace when, for example, people feel daunted from the start, triggering an instinctive defensive reaction that makes it harder for them to solve the problem at hand.
But then there’s discovery mode, where people’s brains are focused on the potential rewards in a situation—for instance, a feeling of belonging or social recognition, or the thrill of learning new things. If leaders can foster a rewarding environment even amid the most difficult situations, it’s likely that they can dampen that primal feeling of being under threat just enough to nudge people out of defensive mode and back into top form.
Ros has put this insight at the heart of her leadership style. First, she creates a positive frame for difficult tasks or discussions. “We’ve got a huge project where 95 percent of it is going fine, but three things aren’t going so well,” she says. “We’re getting a lot of questions about those three things, and I can see my team tensing up whenever we talk about them. So now I always begin our meetings by talking about what we’ve done well. And you can see how it calms everyone down and helps people think more clearly.” She’s keen to emphasize that “it’s not about trying to spin or gloss over the problems. But beginning with what’s working well puts everyone in a more open frame of mind, meaning we can look at what’s not working without people getting defensive.”
By focusing on something positive before getting into the tough stuff, leaders can help people stay in high-performance discovery mode. It doesn’t take much. Research found that when volunteers were given a puzzle where they had to navigate a little mouse out of a maze, all it took to lift their performance by 50 percent was seeing a picture of some cheese next to the exit instead of a menacing owl. In a meeting, the metaphorical “cheese” can even be as simple as discussing the ideal outcome everyone’s shooting for, before talking about the steps to get there.
Ros also reinforces her team’s feelings of autonomy and competence—two things that feel highly rewarding for the average brain. Usually, when a colleague has an issue, leaders help by offering advice or direction. But that can backfire, because a well-intentioned “have you tried this/that . . .” can be subconsciously interpreted as a judgment, as in: “why haven’t you tried this/that?” And this mild cognitive threat can be enough to constrain the deliberate system and make people less creative in their own thinking. The alternative: create space for people to do their own best quality thinking. Ros uses the “extreme listening” technique. She asks someone what they want to think through, and lets them talk without interrupting or making suggestions. Sounds simple, but Ros says it’s rare enough to feel a little strange initially.
She describes the first time she used it with her deputy, Alex. “He had an issue he wanted to talk about” and “I actually explicitly told him the ‘rule’ I was following. I nodded, encouraged him, and asked ‘what else?,’ when he flagged. Within five minutes, he’d literally solved the whole thing himself. We both laughed so hard. It absolutely worked.” Alex went on to use the technique with his colleagues, too, and now it’s a team habit. Ros is clear on the lesson for leaders: helping colleagues feel capable of handling matters on their own “is one of the greatest gifts you can give someone,” providing a great boost to their resilience and confidence.</a>

                                            1.state the evaluative word (mention at least 3 words from the text) !! Technology plays an important part in our daily lives. While many technological developments may beneficial- in the field of medicine, for instance- there are many others whose effects are less possitive. We may find example of these in the world of work, in the home and the whole area of freedom and privacy. In the world of work, technological. advances have had various negative effects. The development of robotics has meant that industries, such as car-manufacturing, robots are replacing people. They work faster and more accurately and they don't need breaks. As a result, industrial workings see job opportunities decreasing further and unemployment levels rising. In addition, more and more people are working from home using personal computers, which meant that they lose the stimulus that comes from working in direct contact with other people and may feel isolated. Finally, there are implications of information technology for freedom and privacy. More facts about individuals are being stored in data banks, which may be accessed through networks of computers. This creates an ever-increasing risk of accidental or deliberate leaking of private details. Every day more information is collected banks, credit card companies, consumer organizations and so on and who is there to keep an eye on what happens to it? It is certainly convenient to store information in this way, but I feel it could lead to long-term problems. There are may be other hidden dangers- theoretically, could a 'thinking' computer start to use data against us? To sum up, I believe that we must be very careful with technology. While it has clear adventages, there is also the danger that it could turn on us and we could find ourselves the victims of our success.</a>

                                            Underline the infinitive phrase that functions as the direct object!The Quantum Learning TenetsThe first Tenet is "Everything Speaks." This concept reminds us that everything we do in the classroom sends a message to students. The way we greet students first thing in the morning or at the beginning of a class sends a message. The way we handle an incorrect response from a student given in front of peers sends a message. Our Environment, the Atmosphere we create, the Design of our lesson delivery or educational tasks, how we dress, the way we listen, or the character traits we model all send messages to our students. By being constantly aware of this important principle we tend to be more deliberate and proactive in orchestrating the messages students receive. This helps us better manage the variables that contribute to an optimal classroom atmosphere and learning environment."Everything is on Purpose" is the second Tenet and it follows logically from the one before it, "Everything Speaks." If everything speaks, then it follows that we want to be purposeful with everything we do in the classroom to get the desired outcome. A focus on the Tenet, "Everything is on Purpose", encourages a greater awareness of all the variables that influence learning. It is this Tenet that helps us to begin to see our role in the classroom differently. We are not in the classroom to dispense knowledge - we are there to orchestrate learning. We are striving to get masterful in this orchestration, and even small variables and details become important to us.</a>

                                            Strategic flooding is a highly risky tactic. It can only be successful if there’s a well-thought-out backup plan and a plan for fast repairs. Floods can result in loss of life and damage homes and businesses, and when the water remains inland for a long time, it can change the landscape through erosion and deposition, forming new tidal channels and creeks.
During the Eighty Years War, as the Spanish army fought to recapture territory in what is now northern Belgium and southwestern Netherlands in the late sixteenth century, the Dutch rebels led by William of Orange decided to use the low-lying, flood-prone landscape to their advantage. In an attempt to liberate Bruges, Ghent and Antwerp from Spanish dominance and defend their territory, the rebels destroyed scawalls at strategic places from 1584 to 1586 to cause deliberate, large-scale floods.
The area flooded during the Eighty Years War became part of a strategic line of defense and remained inundated for more than 100 years in some places, with profound consequences for the landscape. The plan got completely out of hand, and it came at the expense of the countryside of northern Flanders, now Zeeland Flanders.
After the waters receded, a thick layer of clay covered all remnants of buildings and roads in the area. As sea water was used, soil salinity increased, affecting agricultural yields, being as damaging as floods caused by heavy rainfall or storm surges.
According to the text, which of the following statements is FALSE?
(A) Agricultural crops are disturbed because of the rise of soil salinity brought by sea water.
(B) The Dutch utilized the landscape which was easily flooded to beat the Spanish.
(C) Fast restoration was one of the ways to ensure the success of strategic flooding.
(D) Three cities were affected by the flood strategy used by the Dutch.
(E) Erosion caused by floods will alter the landscape.</a>

Some authorities restrict the use of the term to bodies deliberately embalmed with chemicals, but the use of the word to cover accidentally desiccated bodies goes back at least to the 1730s. Mummies of humans and other animals have been found throughout the world, both as a result of natural preservation through unusual conditions, and as cultural artefacts to preserve the dead. At this context, the oldest known naturally mummified human corpse is a decapitated head dated as 6,000 years old, found in 1936 at the site named Inca Cueva No. 4 in South America on the other hand. the oldest-known deliberate mummy is a child from the Camarones Valley in Chile, and dates from around 5050 BC., it belongs to Chinorro mummies, that are dating to thousands of years before the Egyptian mummies (perhaps the most known and famous ). Deliberate mummification is a feature of some ancient South American cultures in areas which, like Egypt, have very dry climates. There are more than 1000 mummies in dry Xinjiang. China. Over one million animal mummies have been found in Egypt, many of which are cats.​​</a>

The time has come to make a positive effort to  overcome the ignorance and misunderstanding about  firearms and the people who use them. Those who  appreciate and enjoy guns and shooting must share their  knowledge and their beliefs with others in their home  communities. They must emphasize to public officials and  people in general the importance of firearms in America: the  positive values of shooting and hunting; the necessity for  firearms safety programs and marksmanship training activi ties of the National Rifle Association and the contribution of  these programs to the American way of life.

The two-system brain
Antony heads a successful technology consultancy that has grown rapidly since it was founded in 2011. Before starting the firm, he worked for a big agency with a toxic culture. “There was a sort of ‘cultural presenteeism’—you needed to look like you were always working.” At his new company, he wanted to forge a very different culture that would enable people to be both innovative and focused, collaborative and emotionally balanced. He and his two cofounders did all the usual things—hired carefully, developed an inspiring vision for the company, and designed an inviting workspace.
But Antony knew enough of the research on optimal brain function to see that more tangible measures were needed. In particular, he raised the issue of information overload and multitasking and how their team could avoid it. Antony knew that the brain’s activity is split across two complementary systems—one deliberate and controlled, the other automatic and instinctive. The deliberate system is responsible for sophisticated, conscious functions such as reasoning, self-control, and forward thinking. It can only do one thing at a time and tires remarkably quickly. The brain’s automatic system lightens this load by automating most of what we do from day to day, but as the brain’s deliberate system becomes more exhausted, the automatic system increasingly takes the reins, leaving us prone to make misleading generalizations and kneejerk responses.
That’s why multitasking is such a problem. We think we can parallel process, but each tiny switch from one conscious task to another—from email to reading to speaking on a conference call, for example—wastes a little of the deliberate system’s time and mental energy. And those switches cost us dearly. Research shows that people are less creative, more stressed, and make two to four times as many mistakes when they deal with interruptions and distractions.
Another way that the deliberate system’s limitations play out in the workplace is that decision-making quality drops the longer people go without a break. Classic cognitive biases like groupthink and confirmation bias take firmer hold, and we’re more prone to sloppy thinking in general. In one study, where hospital leaders were trying to encourage the use of hand sanitizer, they found that compliance rates fell when people worked long hours without a break.
But here’s the silver lining: if leaders can encourage people to go offline when doing their most important work, as well as taking more frequent breaks, they’ll see an uptick in productivity, innovation, and morale.
As Antony thought about how to do this, he knew that a common hurdle to taking breaks and avoiding multitasking was that people often feel they need to show their responsiveness to senior colleagues by being constantly available, whether on email, instant messaging, or in person. So he knew that his own behavior would be central to shifting norms in his organization. He decided to place a timer on his desk to signal that he was taking 25 or 45 minutes to go offline—something that also helped him focus his brain on the task at hand—and wore enormous noise-canceling headphones to amplify the message. And then, between deep working sessions, he would “bugger off for a walk,” as he puts it. The role modeling worked, he says. “It’s become a collective thing in the office now. And everyone’s decided that breaks are a legitimate use of time because we get so much more done afterward.”</a>

4.	In another realm, the term cancer stands as a general term for malignancy. Cancer is Latin for 'crab' and is one of the signs of the zodiac. No doubt, some old-time patho-logist peering through a microscope thought that tumor cells looked like crazed crusta-ceans with pincers meant to harm. The term crab has another medical meaning since pubic lice are often called crabs. Pubic lice cause a nasty infestation, although the Phthirus pubis insects that besiege the groin really do look like crabs and most certainly bite.
5.	The full name for lupus - systemic lupus erythematosus - is a mélange that roughly translates as a systemic disease in which a wolf turns red. The word lupus became part of the name since the lesions in the classic rash allegedly look like the bite or scratch of a wolf. Having never seen the aftermath of such an attack, I cannot verify this resemblance. Nevertheless, the association of a disease with a wolf is alarming. For much of history, wolves have been depicted in fables, myths, and even the Bible as menacing creatures that attack flocks and herds and even snatch little children. Sadly, the fear of wolves has led to extraordinary efforts at extermination, decimat-ing the wolf population in many countries and creating havoc with the ecosystem. Notwithstanding the truth about these apex predators, the popular psyche has identi-fied wolves as big and bad animals to be feared and despised. As strange as it may be, the very same rash that led someone to think of Canis lupus led others to think of Danaus plexippus, as the monarch butterfly is officially known. I would argue that butterflies are among the sweetest and nicest members of the whole animal kingdom. If - in the minds of many - a wolf conjures up dark winter nights, howling cries, and assaults on sheep and little pigs, butterflies call forth warm sunny days on daisy-cover-ed hills.

The Quantum Learning Tenets
The first Tenet is "Everything Speaks." This concept reminds us that everything we do in the classroom sends a message to students. The way we greet students first thing in the morning or at the beginning of a class sends a message. The way we handle an incorrect response from a student given in front of peers sends a message. Our Environment, the Atmosphere we create, the Design of our lesson delivery or educational tasks, how we dress, the way we listen, or the character traits we model all send messages to our students. By being constantly aware of this important principle we tend to be more deliberate and proactive in orchestrating the messages students receive. This helps us better manage the variables that contribute to an optimal classroom atmosphere and learning environment.
"Everything is on Purpose" is the second Tenet and it follows logically from the one before it, "Everything Speaks." If everything speaks, then it follows that we want to be purposeful with everything we do in the classroom to get the desired outcome. A focus on the Tenet, "Everything is on Purpose", encourages a greater awareness of all the variables that influence learning. It is this Tenet that helps us to begin to see our role in the classroom differently. We are not in the classroom to dispense knowledge - we are there to orchestrate learning. We are striving to get masterful in this orchestration, and even small variables and details become important to us.
"Experience Before Label" is an important principle that influences our lesson design and delivery. It means that we involve students in an experience or elicit an experience that they can relate to before we attempt to attach it to any symbolic language or label. From a scientific perspective we are creating schema or a new neural network in the brain before attaching the label. It can also mean that we move the students to inquiry where they are seeking the label or concept before we give it to them. For example, a math teacher may involve students in a real-life situation in which they are trying to solve a problem but having difficulty based on what they already know. They may begin to look for a new formula or principle to help them accomplish the solution. This state of inquiry or searching would be an ideal time for the teacher to introduce the new concept, and this process would be called "Experience Before Label." In a literature class a teacher may have students experience writing from a talented author before introducing the literary concept of mood. A science teacher may have students experience or observe the laws of motion before actually labeling them.</a>

                                            Strategic flooding is a highly risky tactic. It can only be successful if thereâ€™s a well-thought-out backup plan and a plan for fast repairs. Floods can result in loss of life and damage homes and businesses, and when the water remains inland for a long time, it can change the landscape through erosion and deposition, forming new tidal channels and creeks.
During the Eighty Years War, as the Spanish army fought to recapture territory in what is now northern Belgium and southwestern Netherlands in the late sixteenth century, the Dutch rebels led by William of Orange decided to use the low-lying, flood-prone landscape to their advantage. In an attempt to liberate Bruges, Ghent and Antwerp from Spanish dominance and defend their territory, the rebels destroyed scawalls at strategic places from 1584 to 1586 to cause deliberate, large-scale floods.
The area flooded during the Eighty Years War became part of a strategic line of defense and remained inundated for more than 100 years in some places, with profound consequences for the landscape. The plan got completely out of hand, and it came at the expense of the countryside of northern Flanders, now Zeeland Flanders.
After the waters receded, a thick layer of clay covered all remnants of buildings and roads in the area. As sea water was used, soil salinity increased, affecting agricultural yields, being as damaging as floods caused by heavy rainfall or storm surges.

During the Eighty Years War, as the Spanish army fought to recapture territory in what is now northern Belgium and southwestern Netherlands in the late sixteenth century, the Dutch rebels led by William of Orange decided to use the low-lying, flood-prone landscape to their advantage. In an attempt to liberate Bruges, Ghent and Antwerp from Spanish dominance and defend their territory, the rebels destroyed scawalls at strategic places from 1584 to 1586 to cause deliberate, large-scale floods.
The area flooded during the Eighty Years War became part of a strategic line of defense and remained inundated for more than 100 years in some places, with profound consequences for the landscape. The plan got completely out of hand, and it came at the expense of the countryside of northern Flanders, now Zeeland Flanders.
After the waters receded, a thick layer of clay covered all remnants of buildings and roads in the area. As sea water was used, soil salinity increased, affecting agricultural yields, being as damaging as floods caused by heavy rainfall or storm surges.
What inference can you make about strategic flooding?
(A) The impact caused by strategic flooding is more manageable than floods by natural causes.
(B) When carried out without careful planning, it puts a strain on an areaâ€™s food supply.
(C) It is a strategy fraught with danger but worth the risks.
(D) It is one of the most important Dutch inventions.
(E) It causes high levels of soil salinity.</a>

                                            Text I Technology plays an increasingly important part in our daily lives. While many technological developments may be beneficial in the field of medicine, for instance- there are many others whose effects are less positive. We may find examples of these in the world of work, in the home and in the whole area of freedom and privacy In the world of work, technological advances have had various negative effect. The development of robotics has meant that in industries, such as car manufacturing, robots are replacing people. They work faster and more accurately and they don't need breaks. As a result, industrial workers see job opportunities decreasing further and unemployment levels rising. In addition, more and more people are working from home using personal computer, which means that they lose the stimulus that comes from working in direct contact with other people and may feel isolated. Finally, there are the implication of information technology for freedom and privacy more facts about individuals are being stored in data banks, which may be accessed through network of computers. This creates an ever increasing risk of accidental or deliberate leaking of private details. Every day more information is collected by banks, credit card companies, consumer organizations and so on- and who is there to keep an eye on what happens to it? It's certainly convenient to store information in this way, but I feel it could lead to long term problems. There may be other hidden dangers- theorically, could a 'thinking computer start to use the data against us? I sum up, I believe that we must be very careful with technology. While it has clear advantages there is also the danger that it could turn on us and we could find ourselves the victims of our success.1. buat analisis dalam teks tersebut?note; jawabannya pake bahasa Inggris juga ya mohon bantuannya tugas untuk hari ini ​</a>

Some authorities restrict the use of the term to bodies deliberately embalmed with chemicals, but the use of the word to cover accidentally desiccated bodies goes back at least to the 1730s.  Mummies of humans and other animals have been found throughout the world, both as a result of natural preservation through unusual conditions, and as cultural artefacts to preserve the dead.  At this context, the oldest known naturally mummified human corpse is a decapitated head dated as 6,000 years old, found in 1936 at the site named Inca Cueva No.  4 in South America on the other hand.  the oldest-known deliberate mummy is a child from the Camarones Valley in Chile, and dates from around 5050 BC., it belongs to Chinorro mummies, that are dating to thousands of years before the Egyptian mummies (perhaps the most known and famous  ).  Deliberate mummification is a feature of some ancient South American cultures in areas which, like Egypt, have very dry climates.  There are more than 1000 mummies in dry Xinjiang.  China.

</p><p>Mumi adalah tubuh, manusia atau hewan, yang kulit dan organnya telah diawetkan oleh paparan bahan kimia yang disengaja atau tidak disengaja, sangat dingin (es mumi), kelembaban yang sangat rendah, atau kekurangan air ketika tubuh terendam dalam rawa, sehingga tubuh yang pulih tidak akan membusuk lebih lanjut jika disimpan dalam kondisi dingin dan kering. Beberapa pihak berwenang membatasi penggunaan istilah ini untuk tubuh yang sengaja dibalsem dengan bahan kimia, tetapi penggunaan kata untuk menutupi tubuh yang dikeringkan secara tidak sengaja kembali setidaknya ke tahun 1730-an. Mumi manusia dan hewan lainnya telah ditemukan di seluruh dunia, baik sebagai hasil dari pelestarian alam melalui kondisi yang tidak biasa, dan sebagai artefak budaya untuk melindungi orang mati.

The Quantum Learning Tenets
The first Tenet is "Everything Speaks." This concept reminds us that everything we do in the classroom sends a message to students. The way we greet students first thing in the morning or at the beginning of a class sends a message. The way we handle an incorrect response from a student given in front of peers sends a message. Our Environment, the Atmosphere we create, the Design of our lesson delivery or educational tasks, how we dress, the way we listen, or the character traits we model all send messages to our students. By being constantly aware of this important principle we tend to be more deliberate and proactive in orchestrating the messages students receive. This helps us better manage the variables that contribute to an optimal classroom atmosphere and learning environment.
"Everything is on Purpose" is the second Tenet and it follows logically from the one before it, "Everything Speaks." If everything speaks, then it follows that we want to be purposeful with everything we do in the classroom to get the desired outcome. A focus on the Tenet, "Everything is on Purpose", encourages a greater awareness of all the variables that influence learning. It is this Tenet that helps us to begin to see our role in the classroom differently. We are not in the classroom to dispense knowledge - we are there to orchestrate learning. We are striving to get masterful in this orchestration, and even small variables and details become important to us.
"Experience Before Label" is an important principle that influences our lesson design and delivery. It means that we involve students in an experience or elicit an experience that they can relate to before we attempt to attach it to any symbolic language or label. From a scientific perspective we are creating schema or a new neural network in the brain before attaching the label. It can also mean that we move the students to inquiry where they are seeking the label or concept before we give it to them. For example, a math teacher may involve students in a real-life situation in which they are trying to solve a problem but having difficulty based on what they already know. They may begin to look for a new formula or principle to help them accomplish the solution. This state of inquiry or searching would be an ideal time for the teacher to introduce the new concept, and this process would be called "Experience Before Label." In a literature class a teacher may have students experience writing from a talented author before introducing the literary concept of mood. A science teacher may have students experience or observe the laws of motion before actually labeling them.

The discover-defend axis
Ros is one of the most senior leaders in the UK’s state-run healthcare system. She oversees the complex web of relationships between the system’s many payers and providers and ensures that the interactions between the two help rather than hinder improvements in patient care. Budgets are tight and the outcomes of her team’s work are often subject to scrutiny by politicians and the media. So Ros has to help her colleagues stay energized and on their game as they pursue their noble goals, even when the going gets tough. Resilience is key.
The problem is, our brain is constantly looking for threats to fend off or rewards worth pursuing. When we’re more focused on threats than rewards, we’re in defensive mode. Our brain diverts some of its scarce mental energy into launching a ‘fight’, ‘flight,’ or ‘freeze’ response, and as those instinctive responses unfold—looking more like ‘snap, sulk, or skulk’ in the workplace—brain scans show less activity in the parts of the brain known as the prefrontal cortex. To put it another way: some of our more emotionally sophisticated neural machinery has gone offline.
This matters, because it takes surprisingly little to put someone’s brain into defensive mode—anything threatening a person’s self-worth, even the smallest social slight. This can create vicious circles in the workplace when, for example, people feel daunted from the start, triggering an instinctive defensive reaction that makes it harder for them to solve the problem at hand.
But then there’s discovery mode, where people’s brains are focused on the potential rewards in a situation—for instance, a feeling of belonging or social recognition, or the thrill of learning new things. If leaders can foster a rewarding environment even amid the most difficult situations, it’s likely that they can dampen that primal feeling of being under threat just enough to nudge people out of defensive mode and back into top form.
Ros has put this insight at the heart of her leadership style. First, she creates a positive frame for difficult tasks or discussions. “We’ve got a huge project where 95 percent of it is going fine, but three things aren’t going so well,” she says. “We’re getting a lot of questions about those three things, and I can see my team tensing up whenever we talk about them. So now I always begin our meetings by talking about what we’ve done well. And you can see how it calms everyone down and helps people think more clearly.” She’s keen to emphasize that “it’s not about trying to spin or gloss over the problems. But beginning with what’s working well puts everyone in a more open frame of mind, meaning we can look at what’s not working without people getting defensive.”
By focusing on something positive before getting into the tough stuff, leaders can help people stay in high-performance discovery mode. It doesn’t take much. Research found that when volunteers were given a puzzle where they had to navigate a little mouse out of a maze, all it took to lift their performance by 50 percent was seeing a picture of some cheese next to the exit instead of a menacing owl. In a meeting, the metaphorical “cheese” can even be as simple as discussing the ideal outcome everyone’s shooting for, before talking about the steps to get there.
Ros also reinforces her team’s feelings of autonomy and competence—two things that feel highly rewarding for the average brain. Usually, when a colleague has an issue, leaders help by offering advice or direction. But that can backfire, because a well-intentioned “have you tried this/that . . .” can be subconsciously interpreted as a judgment, as in: “why haven’t you tried this/that?” And this mild cognitive threat can be enough to constrain the deliberate system and make people less creative in their own thinking. The alternative: create space for people to do their own best quality thinking. Ros uses the “extreme listening” technique. She asks someone what they want to think through, and lets them talk without interrupting or making suggestions. Sounds simple, but Ros says it’s rare enough to feel a little strange initially.
She describes the first time she used it with her deputy, Alex. “He had an issue he wanted to talk about” and “I actually explicitly told him the ‘rule’ I was following. I nodded, encouraged him, and asked ‘what else?,’ when he flagged. Within five minutes, he’d literally solved the whole thing himself. We both laughed so hard. It absolutely worked.” Alex went on to use the technique with his colleagues, too, and now it’s a team habit. Ros is clear on the lesson for leaders: helping colleagues feel capable of handling matters on their own “is one of the greatest gifts you can give someone,” providing a great boost to their resilience and confidence.</h2><br />

While many technological developments may beneficial- in the field of medicine, for instance- there are many others whose effects are less possitive. We may find example of these in the world of work, in the home and the whole area of freedom and privacy. In the world of work, technological. advances have had various negative effects. The development of robotics has meant that industries, such as car-manufacturing, robots are replacing people. They work faster and more accurately and they don't need breaks. As a result, industrial workings see job opportunities decreasing further and unemployment levels rising. In addition, more and more people are working from home using personal computers, which meant that they lose the stimulus that comes from working in direct contact with other people and may feel isolated. Finally, there are implications of information technology for freedom and privacy. More facts about individuals are being stored in data banks, which may be accessed through networks of computers. This creates an ever-increasing risk of accidental or deliberate leaking of private details. Every day more information is collected banks, credit card companies, consumer organizations and so on and who is there to keep an eye on what happens to it? It is certainly convenient to store information in this way, but I feel it could lead to long-term problems. There are may be other hidden dangers- theoretically, could a 'thinking' computer start to use data against us? To sum up, I believe that we must be very careful with technology. While it has clear adventages, there is also the danger that it could turn on us and we could find ourselves the victims of our success.</h2><br />

                            12. Underline the infinitive phrase that functions as the direct object!The Quantum Learning TenetsThe first Tenet is "Everything Speaks." This concept reminds us that everything we do in the classroom sends a message to students. The way we greet students first thing in the morning or at the beginning of a class sends a message. The way we handle an incorrect response from a student given in front of peers sends a message. Our Environment, the Atmosphere we create, the Design of our lesson delivery or educational tasks, how we dress, the way we listen, or the character traits we model all send messages to our students. By being constantly aware of this important principle we tend to be more deliberate and proactive in orchestrating the messages students receive. This helps us better manage the variables that contribute to an optimal classroom atmosphere and learning environment."Everything is on Purpose" is the second Tenet and it follows logically from the one before it, "Everything Speaks." If everything speaks, then it follows that we want to be purposeful with everything we do in the classroom to get the desired outcome. A focus on the Tenet, "Everything is on Purpose", encourages a greater awareness of all the variables that influence learning. It is this Tenet that helps us to begin to see our role in the classroom differently. We are not in the classroom to dispense knowledge - we are there to orchestrate learning. We are striving to get masterful in this orchestration, and even small variables and details become important to us.</h2><br />

                            14. Strategic flooding is a highly risky tactic. It can only be successful if there’s a well-thought-out backup plan and a plan for fast repairs. Floods can result in loss of life and damage homes and businesses, and when the water remains inland for a long time, it can change the landscape through erosion and deposition, forming new tidal channels and creeks.
During the Eighty Years War, as the Spanish army fought to recapture territory in what is now northern Belgium and southwestern Netherlands in the late sixteenth century, the Dutch rebels led by William of Orange decided to use the low-lying, flood-prone landscape to their advantage. In an attempt to liberate Bruges, Ghent and Antwerp from Spanish dominance and defend their territory, the rebels destroyed scawalls at strategic places from 1584 to 1586 to cause deliberate, large-scale floods.
The area flooded during the Eighty Years War became part of a strategic line of defense and remained inundated for more than 100 years in some places, with profound consequences for the landscape. The plan got completely out of hand, and it came at the expense of the countryside of northern Flanders, now Zeeland Flanders.
After the waters receded, a thick layer of clay covered all remnants of buildings and roads in the area. As sea water was used, soil salinity increased, affecting agricultural yields, being as damaging as floods caused by heavy rainfall or storm surges.
According to the text, which of the following statements is FALSE?
(A) Agricultural crops are disturbed because of the rise of soil salinity brought by sea water.
(B) The Dutch utilized the landscape which was easily flooded to beat the Spanish.
(C) Fast restoration was one of the ways to ensure the success of strategic flooding.
(D) Three cities were affected by the flood strategy used by the Dutch.
(E) Erosion caused by floods will alter the landscape.</h2><br />

Some authorities restrict the use of the term to bodies deliberately embalmed with chemicals, but the use of the word to cover accidentally desiccated bodies goes back at least to the 1730s. Mummies of humans and other animals have been found throughout the world, both as a result of natural preservation through unusual conditions, and as cultural artefacts to preserve the dead. At this context, the oldest known naturally mummified human corpse is a decapitated head dated as 6,000 years old, found in 1936 at the site named Inca Cueva No. 4 in South America on the other hand. the oldest-known deliberate mummy is a child from the Camarones Valley in Chile, and dates from around 5050 BC., it belongs to Chinorro mummies, that are dating to thousands of years before the Egyptian mummies (perhaps the most known and famous ). Deliberate mummification is a feature of some ancient South American cultures in areas which, like Egypt, have very dry climates. There are more than 1000 mummies in dry Xinjiang. China. Over one million animal mummies have been found in Egypt, many of which are cats.​​</h2><br />

United We Stand  UNITED WE STAND  Members of the National Rifle Association of America  and other reputable gun owners are being maligned by  sensational reporting on the part of some writers. By means  of cleverly written articles, these authors are presenting  vehement diatribes against firearms of all description,  against NRA, and against gun owners in general. Some reek  17 of bigotry and parochial thinking, while others appears to be  a deliberate attempt to divide and conquer.   The time has come to make a positive effort to  overcome the ignorance and misunderstanding about  firearms and the people who use them. Those who  appreciate and enjoy guns and shooting must share their  knowledge and their beliefs with others in their home  communities. They must emphasize to public officials and  people in general the importance of firearms in America: the  positive values of shooting and hunting; the necessity for  firearms safety programs and marksmanship training activi ties of the National Rifle Association and the contribution of  these programs to the American way of life. Those who have  most to gain, and most to lose, must convince their friends  and associates that guns and shooting are an essential part  of our priceless heritage which must be cherished and  Unit 6. Bias  encouraged. They must make known the true facts about the  RNA, its affiliated shooting organizations, and its members in  every state of the Union.

The two-system brain
Antony heads a successful technology consultancy that has grown rapidly since it was founded in 2011. Before starting the firm, he worked for a big agency with a toxic culture. “There was a sort of ‘cultural presenteeism’—you needed to look like you were always working.” At his new company, he wanted to forge a very different culture that would enable people to be both innovative and focused, collaborative and emotionally balanced. He and his two cofounders did all the usual things—hired carefully, developed an inspiring vision for the company, and designed an inviting workspace.
But Antony knew enough of the research on optimal brain function to see that more tangible measures were needed. In particular, he raised the issue of information overload and multitasking and how their team could avoid it. Antony knew that the brain’s activity is split across two complementary systems—one deliberate and controlled, the other automatic and instinctive. The deliberate system is responsible for sophisticated, conscious functions such as reasoning, self-control, and forward thinking. It can only do one thing at a time and tires remarkably quickly. The brain’s automatic system lightens this load by automating most of what we do from day to day, but as the brain’s deliberate system becomes more exhausted, the automatic system increasingly takes the reins, leaving us prone to make misleading generalizations and kneejerk responses.
That’s why multitasking is such a problem. We think we can parallel process, but each tiny switch from one conscious task to another—from email to reading to speaking on a conference call, for example—wastes a little of the deliberate system’s time and mental energy. And those switches cost us dearly. Research shows that people are less creative, more stressed, and make two to four times as many mistakes when they deal with interruptions and distractions.
Another way that the deliberate system’s limitations play out in the workplace is that decision-making quality drops the longer people go without a break. Classic cognitive biases like groupthink and confirmation bias take firmer hold, and we’re more prone to sloppy thinking in general. In one study, where hospital leaders were trying to encourage the use of hand sanitizer, they found that compliance rates fell when people worked long hours without a break.
But here’s the silver lining: if leaders can encourage people to go offline when doing their most important work, as well as taking more frequent breaks, they’ll see an uptick in productivity, innovation, and morale.
As Antony thought about how to do this, he knew that a common hurdle to taking breaks and avoiding multitasking was that people often feel they need to show their responsiveness to senior colleagues by being constantly available, whether on email, instant messaging, or in person. So he knew that his own behavior would be central to shifting norms in his organization. He decided to place a timer on his desk to signal that he was taking 25 or 45 minutes to go offline—something that also helped him focus his brain on the task at hand—and wore enormous noise-canceling headphones to amplify the message. And then, between deep working sessions, he would “bugger off for a walk,” as he puts it. The role modeling worked, he says. “It’s become a collective thing in the office now. And everyone’s decided that breaks are a legitimate use of time because we get so much more done afterward.”</h2><br />

4.	In another realm, the term cancer stands as a general term for malignancy. Cancer is Latin for 'crab' and is one of the signs of the zodiac. No doubt, some old-time patho-logist peering through a microscope thought that tumor cells looked like crazed crusta-ceans with pincers meant to harm. The term crab has another medical meaning since pubic lice are often called crabs. Pubic lice cause a nasty infestation, although the Phthirus pubis insects that besiege the groin really do look like crabs and most certainly bite.
5.	The full name for lupus - systemic lupus erythematosus - is a mélange that roughly translates as a systemic disease in which a wolf turns red. The word lupus became part of the name since the lesions in the classic rash allegedly look like the bite or scratch of a wolf. Having never seen the aftermath of such an attack, I cannot verify this resemblance. Nevertheless, the association of a disease with a wolf is alarming. For much of history, wolves have been depicted in fables, myths, and even the Bible as menacing creatures that attack flocks and herds and even snatch little children. Sadly, the fear of wolves has led to extraordinary efforts at extermination, decimat-ing the wolf population in many countries and creating havoc with the ecosystem. Notwithstanding the truth about these apex predators, the popular psyche has identi-fied wolves as big and bad animals to be feared and despised. As strange as it may be, the very same rash that led someone to think of Canis lupus led others to think of Danaus plexippus, as the monarch butterfly is officially known. I would argue that butterflies are among the sweetest and nicest members of the whole animal kingdom. If - in the minds of many - a wolf conjures up dark winter nights, howling cries, and assaults on sheep and little pigs, butterflies call forth warm sunny days on daisy-cover-ed hills.

The Quantum Learning Tenets
The first Tenet is "Everything Speaks." This concept reminds us that everything we do in the classroom sends a message to students. The way we greet students first thing in the morning or at the beginning of a class sends a message. The way we handle an incorrect response from a student given in front of peers sends a message. Our Environment, the Atmosphere we create, the Design of our lesson delivery or educational tasks, how we dress, the way we listen, or the character traits we model all send messages to our students. By being constantly aware of this important principle we tend to be more deliberate and proactive in orchestrating the messages students receive. This helps us better manage the variables that contribute to an optimal classroom atmosphere and learning environment.
"Everything is on Purpose" is the second Tenet and it follows logically from the one before it, "Everything Speaks." If everything speaks, then it follows that we want to be purposeful with everything we do in the classroom to get the desired outcome. A focus on the Tenet, "Everything is on Purpose", encourages a greater awareness of all the variables that influence learning. It is this Tenet that helps us to begin to see our role in the classroom differently. We are not in the classroom to dispense knowledge - we are there to orchestrate learning. We are striving to get masterful in this orchestration, and even small variables and details become important to us.
"Experience Before Label" is an important principle that influences our lesson design and delivery. It means that we involve students in an experience or elicit an experience that they can relate to before we attempt to attach it to any symbolic language or label. From a scientific perspective we are creating schema or a new neural network in the brain before attaching the label. It can also mean that we move the students to inquiry where they are seeking the label or concept before we give it to them. For example, a math teacher may involve students in a real-life situation in which they are trying to solve a problem but having difficulty based on what they already know. They may begin to look for a new formula or principle to help them accomplish the solution. This state of inquiry or searching would be an ideal time for the teacher to introduce the new concept, and this process would be called "Experience Before Label." In a literature class a teacher may have students experience writing from a talented author before introducing the literary concept of mood. A science teacher may have students experience or observe the laws of motion before actually labeling them.</h2><br />

Contoh nyata di lingkungan sekitar dari Deliberate formation,dan spontaneous formation</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Penjelasan:</strong></p><p>Contoh nyata dari Deliberate Formation (pembentukan yang disengaja) bisa berupa pembangunan sebuah gedung atau proyek infrastruktur. Misalnya, ketika sebuah pemerintah atau perusahaan merencanakan dan membangun sebuah jembatan baru di wilayah tertentu, itu adalah contoh pembentukan yang disengaja. Hal ini melibatkan perencanaan yang matang, alokasi sumber daya, dan pemilihan lokasi yang sesuai.</p><p></p><p>Contoh nyata dari Spontaneous Formation (pembentukan spontan) bisa berupa komunitas yang berkembang secara alami tanpa perencanaan yang ketat. Misalnya, sebuah komunitas seni yang tumbuh di lingkungan tertentu karena adanya minat bersama dalam seni. Orang-orang dengan minat yang sama secara spontan berkumpul, berkolaborasi, dan membentuk sebuah komunitas seni tanpa perlu rencana yang terperinci.</p><p></p><p>Pembentukan yang disengaja adalah ketika ada niat dan upaya yang sadar untuk menciptakan sesuatu, sementara pembentukan spontan terjadi tanpa perencanaan yang eksplisit dan seringkali muncul karena minat, kebutuhan, atau dinamika alamiah dalam masyarakat atau lingkungan tertentu.</p><br />

                            28. Strategic flooding is a highly risky tactic. It can only be successful if thereâ€™s a well-thought-out backup plan and a plan for fast repairs. Floods can result in loss of life and damage homes and businesses, and when the water remains inland for a long time, it can change the landscape through erosion and deposition, forming new tidal channels and creeks.
During the Eighty Years War, as the Spanish army fought to recapture territory in what is now northern Belgium and southwestern Netherlands in the late sixteenth century, the Dutch rebels led by William of Orange decided to use the low-lying, flood-prone landscape to their advantage. In an attempt to liberate Bruges, Ghent and Antwerp from Spanish dominance and defend their territory, the rebels destroyed scawalls at strategic places from 1584 to 1586 to cause deliberate, large-scale floods.
The area flooded during the Eighty Years War became part of a strategic line of defense and remained inundated for more than 100 years in some places, with profound consequences for the landscape. The plan got completely out of hand, and it came at the expense of the countryside of northern Flanders, now Zeeland Flanders.
After the waters receded, a thick layer of clay covered all remnants of buildings and roads in the area. As sea water was used, soil salinity increased, affecting agricultural yields, being as damaging as floods caused by heavy rainfall or storm surges.

                            30. Strategic flooding is a highly risky tactic. It can only be successful if thereâ€™s a well-thought-out backup plan and a plan for fast repairs. Floods can result in loss of life and damage homes and businesses, and when the water remains inland for a long time, it can change the landscape through erosion and deposition, forming new tidal channels and creeks.

What inference can you make about strategic flooding?
(A) The impact caused by strategic flooding is more manageable than floods by natural causes.
(B) When carried out without careful planning, it puts a strain on an areaâ€™s food supply.
(C) It is a strategy fraught with danger but worth the risks.
(D) It is one of the most important Dutch inventions.
(E) It causes high levels of soil salinity.</h2><br />
                        <p>The answer is <strong>(B) When carried out without careful planning, it puts a strain on an area's food supply. </strong>As stated in the last sentence of the paragraph, that the <strong>strategic flooding </strong>by the Dutch rebels caused the sea water inundates the land resulting the <strong>soil salinity </strong>increased which <strong>affecting agricultural </strong>yields. That means it is going to <strong>damage </strong>food supply in the area flooded by sea water.</p><p> </p><strong>Pembahasan</strong><p>Terjemahan dari jawaban:</p><p>Jawabannya adalah (B) Jika dilakukan tanpa perencanaan yang matang, akan membebani suplai pangan suatu daerah. Sebagaimana dinyatakan dalam kalimat terakhir paragraf, bahwa "<strong>taktik membuat banjir</strong>" (strategic flooding) oleh pemberontak Belanda menyebabkan air laut menggenangi daratan sehingga salinitas tanah meningkat yang mempengaruhi hasil pertanian. Artinya, akan merusak suplai pangan di wilayah yang tergenang air laut.</p><p>Jawaban B tepat karena pertanyaanya adalah: Apa yang dapat kamu simpulkan dari banjir buatan? Sedangkan pilihan jawaban lain tidak tepat karena memiliki makna:</p>(A) Dampak yang ditimbulkan oleh banjir buatan lebih dapat dikendalikan daripada banjir yang disebabkan oleh faktor alam. Yang mana bertentangan dengan kalimat terakhir dalam paragraf yaitu "as damaging as floods caused by heavy rainfall or storm surges."(C) Ini adalah strategi yang penuh dengan bahaya tetapi sepadan dengan risikonya. Faktanya risikonya tidak sepadan apabila tidak diimbangi dengan rencana cadangan yang dipikirkan dengan matang dan juga rencana untuk perbaikan yang cepat.(D) Ini adalah salah satu penemuan Belanda yang paling penting.(E) Menyebabkan tingkat salinitas tanah yang tinggi. Jawaban ini mendekati benar, namun jawabannya kurang lengkap.<p></p>Pelajari lebih lanjutMateri tentang terjemahan teks pada buku brainly.co.id/tugas/16530961Materi tentang terjemahan teks brainly.co.id/tugas/16753112Materi tentang arti kata dear brainly.co.id/tugas/1647720<p></p>Detail jawaban<p><strong>Kelas: </strong>SBMPTN</p><p><strong>Mapel: </strong>Bahasa Inggris</p><p><strong>Bab: </strong>Reading and Vocabulary</p><p><strong>Kode: </strong>-</p><p></p><p><strong>#AyoBelajar #SPJ2</strong></p><br />

                            33. Text I Technology plays an increasingly important part in our daily lives. While many technological developments may be beneficial in the field of medicine, for instance- there are many others whose effects are less positive. We may find examples of these in the world of work, in the home and in the whole area of freedom and privacy In the world of work, technological advances have had various negative effect. The development of robotics has meant that in industries, such as car manufacturing, robots are replacing people. They work faster and more accurately and they don't need breaks. As a result, industrial workers see job opportunities decreasing further and unemployment levels rising. In addition, more and more people are working from home using personal computer, which means that they lose the stimulus that comes from working in direct contact with other people and may feel isolated. Finally, there are the implication of information technology for freedom and privacy more facts about individuals are being stored in data banks, which may be accessed through network of computers. This creates an ever increasing risk of accidental or deliberate leaking of private details. Every day more information is collected by banks, credit card companies, consumer organizations and so on- and who is there to keep an eye on what happens to it? It's certainly convenient to store information in this way, but I feel it could lead to long term problems. There may be other hidden dangers- theorically, could a 'thinking computer start to use the data against us? I sum up, I believe that we must be very careful with technology. While it has clear advantages there is also the danger that it could turn on us and we could find ourselves the victims of our success.1. buat analisis dalam teks tersebut?note; jawabannya pake bahasa Inggris juga ya mohon bantuannya tugas untuk hari ini ​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Jawaban:<br />Mapel: Bhs Inggris<br />Kelas: 11 SMA<br /><br /></strong>In the given text, the author presents a critical analysis of the role of technology in our daily lives. The text highlights both the positive and negative effects of technological advancements.</p><p></p><p>The author acknowledges the beneficial impact of technology in fields like medicine. However, the text emphasizes that there are also negative consequences. In the world of work, robotics and automation are replacing human workers, leading to job losses and higher unemployment rates. Additionally, the rise of remote work through personal computers can result in isolation and a lack of human interaction.</p><p></p><p>The text also raises concerns about the implications of information technology on freedom and privacy. The increasing storage of personal information in databases and its accessibility through computer networks raises the risk of privacy breaches. The author questions the oversight and control over the collection and usage of personal data by various institutions.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, the text speculates on the potential hidden dangers of technology, suggesting the possibility of a "thinking computer" potentially using the gathered data against individuals.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, the author advocates for caution in embracing technology. While acknowledging its advantages, the author warns of the potential risks and the need to prevent technology from turning against us.</p><p></p><p><strong>Penjelasan:</strong></p><p><strong>Semoga Bermanfaat</strong></p><br />
