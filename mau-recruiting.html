Ever noticed how the whole of the recruitment world seems to speak in code? Take one recent example: ‘Our client is prestigious (translation: arrogant and self-serving), recently restructured (downsized) company seeking to recruit (hello, that downsizing went a bit too far) a self-motivated (you’ll be on your own), hands-on (you’ll get no support), ambitious (24/7 is your world) business development (sales) director (the lower case ‘d’ means you won’t be on the board).’
Look closely at job advertising and you will find plenty pure rubbish too: a salary described as ‘circa $32,245’ (the implication being, presumably, that you could argue over the pence) pr, to quote from an ad for a communication director. ‘the successful candidate must have the proven ability to demonstrate the facility to exhibit a range of excellent communications skill – clearly necessary as the writer couldn’t.
Hidden away in all this code is the challenge to find which jobs you should apply for “The first rule of thumb is that you need to be at least “90%” there in meeting the minimum advertised requirements.’ Say Nick Marsh of recruiters Odgers International. An Important part the decoding is being able to spot an opportunity where you are needed and your skills are valued, ‘Oddly enough, your example of the recently restructured company probably represent a far better career opportunity tan if it were for a company that was cruising along quite successfully and quite comfortably,’ he says. ‘When companies are faced with challenges, there is the chance to make an impact, so the genuinely more exciting opportunities may well be with a company recruiting after restructure.’
Marsh says you should read every advertisement as a whole, trying to get feel for the overall flavour of the person required and the style of the organisation, rather than poring over every word and phrase. “You must also decide whether the type employer and the role appeal. If you’re not sure, do more research on the company. But most important, you must match the stated qualifications. I’m still amazed how many replies simply don’t meet the minimum requirements. Worse still, some candidates go through the whole process before considering the basics. To be offered the job and then say you don’t want to work in that town unforgivable and reflects badly on your own judgement. On the other hand, do not be deterred if the advertisement doesn’t give you all the information you might like. If details are left out – for example, employer identity or salary information – there will be good reasons for it, so don’t jump to conclusions.
Of course, the real trick is to be truly the ‘ideal candidate’, exactly matching all the requirements. In which casem you need to be selective, says Marsh. ‘Only apply for jibs where you can tick all the boxes. Job ads don’t tend to ask for an exhaustive list of requirements so, if you match the five stipulated criteria, create a CV and covering letter that explicitly demonstrates how you match each of those five. Better one such customised application than 20 standard CVs you sent off speculatively.
The bottom line is that the only jobs that are worth going for are those which are suitable for your core skills and Marsh points out, we all have only two or three things at which we truly excel. ‘Know what you’re outstandingly good at and focus on your applications based on those skills and you won’t go far wrong.’
1. One piece of advice Nick Marsh gives in the fourth paragraph is that
a. The absence of certain information should not be regarded with suspicion.
b. Employers are impressed it applicants have dobe research on their companies.
c. Location is a crucial factor when considering whether to accept an offer or not.
d. Studying adverts too closely can cause applicants to get the wrong impression.
2. In the fifth paragraph, Nick Marsh advises against
a. Making speculative job applications.
b. Exaggerating your suitability for a job.
c. Putting your own interpretation on a job advertisement.
d. Expecting to meet all the stated criteria.
3.What is meant in the context by the phrase ‘The bottom line’ (last paragraph)?
a. The minimum requirement
b. The final consideration
c. The most important point 
d. The unfortunate truth</a>

I am applying for a position as Sales Manager with your company, as I feel my background in developing a sales department will be of interest to you.
As my resume indicates, I joined PT. Bakrie Electric., in the capacity of trainee and moved up the ladder to my current position of Sales Manager. In each year of my employment, I was successful in opening news account, penetrating existing ones, and reopening closed business. As a result, I was responsible for sales increase of 20% to 25%.
As sales manager I was involved in recruiting, training, and supervising a staff of 120 salespeople and was responsible for sales worldwide.
I am looking forward to meeting you. When can we set up an appointment for an interview? I may be reached at 021-7756729.

                                            Read again the article entitled “Speaking Up for The Mother Tongue” and answer the following question:Identify the collocations (VERB + ADJECTIVE) in the following paragraphs.This month the world celebrates International Mother Tongue Language Day – not just a fond commemoration of culture and custom, but a reminder of very current tensions over language and education in developing countries. And the prominence of English as a lingua franca is at the heart of the problem.The idea that English language skills are the key to unlocking access to professional training, investment and business opportunities is short-sighted. The impact of English might be immediate as a quick fix, but there are negative consequences for the longer-term development of a country and its people. Over the long-term it means widening the divide between those able to benefit fully from the education system and the opportunities that follow and those who are not, storing up social problems and limiting the contribution of vast numbers of people to the larger development aims.People in schools, families and governments in many countries know that the way language is handled in basic education is not working. They know that many children learn very little in school, and that one of the main reasons for achieving poorly or dropping out is not being able to understand or use the language of teaching and examinations. This effect is most dramatic where there is poverty and poor teaching quality.Children in these settings know this best of all, struggling through hours of classes trying to make a torrent of unfamiliar words make sense – or realising during an exam that they couldn't pass because they do not understand the questions. Some never go to school, knowing that their language and identity will not be welcome. These issues are estimated to affect 221 million school-aged children worldwide.The question now is how true multilingual education in Africa, Asia and Latin America can be made possible. The barriers are huge.This month the UK-based education and development charities CfBT and Save the Children publish joint research into work being done to spread mother tongue-based multilingual education projects across school systems. This has highlighted many of the problems, but also the most effective ways to make the change really happen.Our aim has been to identify the kind of approach that would create the right balance: respecting communities' rights to maintain and develop their own cultural identities and languages while also promoting strong skills across the curriculum and in "prestige languages" considered important for taking up economic and social opportunities.Our research focused on two well-developed multilingual education projects run by Save the Children with local partners in Vietnam and Bangladesh, as well as material from government-led projects in Andhra Pradesh and Orissa in India. Talking to teachers, NGO staff and academics, we found that a recurring theme was the fear, shared by government, school leadership and parents, that by reducing second language use in schools young people would become less skilled in languages that may have special status at regional, national or international levels.Local officials worry about implementing any policies without central approval. There are problems with recruiting teachers with mother tongue ability, and doubts over the cost of implementing complex multilingual systems. Ultimately the problem is the lack of demand from the top of education systems, only a concern with driving short-term economic improvement projects.The major reason for the failure of multilingual education programmes appears to be lack of understanding of their importance. Government and education leaders need to be presented with the evidence from pilot work, and from countries with similar contexts, that using the mother tongue as the medium of instruction for as long as possible at primary level, while gradually introducing a second language, helps students to acquire second language skills more quickly and effectively.Multilingual projects can also be hampered by rapid changes of education personnel while new approaches are tried and established. The development of clear guidelines for policy implementation and cascaded training will help address this.Success of multilingual schemes will be helped massively by finding and developing teachers who can use the children's language confidently. It is imperative to get speakers of minority or local languages into teaching wherever possible, and as soon as possible.Education and finance ministries should target resources at areas where data indicates that ethnicity and language is a key factor in poor school achievement and retention. In those areas local education authorities should be given autonomy over how they deliver education so that the</a>

                                            Rositza Broncheau – Bulgarian nurse
 Di bawah ini adalah biografi seorang perawat Bulgaria yang melamar pekerjaan di United Kingdom. Gunakan informasi dalam biografi untuk menjawab pertanyaan setelahnya.
 When she was a child, Rosita wanted to be a doctor not a nurse born on 1st July 1973 in Plovdiv. Her first memories are of playing “doctor “ – her favourite game. First She use her dolls as patients and later she used her friends while her father lounging in front of the TV set, Rosita would bandage his arm and legs and pop a thermometer into his mouth.
 After primary school, there followed four years at 27 secondary school Vazov. Rosita worked hard but she didn’t like academic work and so did not do well enough to became a doctor. However, she scored an average of 5 in the diploma of completed secondary education and this was enough for her to get into the Medical University in Sofia in 1992 to take a BSc degree in nursing.
 While she was studying, she fell in love with a medical student called Ilya botched. They had a short romance and married in 1994. In some ways it was a mistake, a year later, Ilya left to work in Syria, fell in love with someone else while he was there and on January 15th May 1996 Ilya and Rosita was discovered. Rosita was pregnant where Ilya left for Africa and on 14th 1995, she had a son, Ivan. Rosita kept her married name.
Rosita’s first job was at the Pirogue Emergency hospital in Sofia. She stays for two years, getting as much experience as possible and also extending her qualifications with a Certificate in Orthopaedic Nursing. She also studied English in her spare time and in October 1997 she passed the Cambridge FCE. She left the Pirogue in November 1997 and took up a post as staff nurse at the Aleksandrovsk Hospital. She also moved into a new flat at number, Gurov street Sofia 1602.
All this time, Ivan was growing up. It was difficult for Rosita to be a mother and have a career. Money was tight and, when she heard that UK NHS trusts were recruiting nurses from outside the UK, she decided to apply for a job.
Her sisters was already in England and, besides, Rosita wanted to leave behind unhappy memories, and make a fresh start. She decided that if she got a job there, she would go alone, settle and sent for Ivan later.

Ever noticed how the whole of the recruitment world seems to speak in code? Take one recent example: ‘Our client is prestigious (translation: arrogant and self-serving), recently restructured (downsized) company seeking to recruit (hello, that downsizing went a bit too far) a self-motivated (you’ll be on your own), hands-on (you’ll get no support), ambitious (24/7 is your world) business development (sales) director (the lower case ‘d’ means you won’t be on the board).’
Look closely at job advertising and you will find plenty pure rubbish too: a salary described as ‘circa $32,245’ (the implication being, presumably, that you could argue over the pence) pr, to quote from an ad for a communication director. ‘the successful candidate must have the proven ability to demonstrate the facility to exhibit a range of excellent communications skill – clearly necessary as the writer couldn’t.
Hidden away in all this code is the challenge to find which jobs you should apply for “The first rule of thumb is that you need to be at least “90%” there in meeting the minimum advertised requirements.’ Say Nick Marsh of recruiters Odgers International. An Important part the decoding is being able to spot an opportunity where you are needed and your skills are valued, ‘Oddly enough, your example of the recently restructured company probably represent a far better career opportunity tan if it were for a company that was cruising along quite successfully and quite comfortably,’ he says. ‘When companies are faced with challenges, there is the chance to make an impact, so the genuinely more exciting opportunities may well be with a company recruiting after restructure.’
Marsh says you should read every advertisement as a whole, trying to get feel for the overall flavour of the person required and the style of the organisation, rather than poring over every word and phrase. “You must also decide whether the type employer and the role appeal. If you’re not sure, do more research on the company. But most important, you must match the stated qualifications. I’m still amazed how many replies simply don’t meet the minimum requirements. Worse still, some candidates go through the whole process before considering the basics. To be offered the job and then say you don’t want to work in that town unforgivable and reflects badly on your own judgement. On the other hand, do not be deterred if the advertisement doesn’t give you all the information you might like. If details are left out – for example, employer identity or salary information – there will be good reasons for it, so don’t jump to conclusions.
Of course, the real trick is to be truly the ‘ideal candidate’, exactly matching all the requirements. In which casem you need to be selective, says Marsh. ‘Only apply for jibs where you can tick all the boxes. Job ads don’t tend to ask for an exhaustive list of requirements so, if you match the five stipulated criteria, create a CV and covering letter that explicitly demonstrates how you match each of those five. Better one such customised application than 20 standard CVs you sent off speculatively.
The bottom line is that the only jobs that are worth going for are those which are suitable for your core skills and Marsh points out, we all have only two or three things at which we truly excel. ‘Know what you’re outstandingly good at and focus on your applications based on those skills and you won’t go far wrong.’
1. The writer’s aim in the first paragraph is to suggest that
a. Job advertisement should use simpler terms than they often do.
b. Certain terms have become fashionable in job advertisement.

2. In the second paragraph, the writer refers to an advertisement that

c. Exaggerates the requirements of the job.
d. Present information unlikely to be true.
3. In the third paragraph, Nick Marsh says that it can be a good idea to

b. Look for companies whose recruitment policies are unusual.
c. Disregard some of what companies say in their job advertisements.
d. Apply to companies that may be seen as experiencing problems at the moments.</a>

Ever noticed how the whole of the recruitment world seems to speak in code? Take one recent example: ‘Our client is prestigious (translation: arrogant and self-serving), recently restructured (downsized) company seeking to recruit (hello, that downsizing went a bit too far) a self-motivated (you’ll be on your own), hands-on (you’ll get no support), ambitious (24/7 is your world) business development (sales) director (the lower case ‘d’ means you won’t be on the board).’
Look closely at job advertising and you will find plenty pure rubbish too: a salary described as ‘circa $32,245’ (the implication being, presumably, that you could argue over the pence) pr, to quote from an ad for a communication director. ‘the successful candidate must have the proven ability to demonstrate the facility to exhibit a range of excellent communications skill – clearly necessary as the writer couldn’t.
Hidden away in all this code is the challenge to find which jobs you should apply for “The first rule of thumb is that you need to be at least “90%” there in meeting the minimum advertised requirements.’ Say Nick Marsh of recruiters Odgers International. An Important part the decoding is being able to spot an opportunity where you are needed and your skills are valued, ‘Oddly enough, your example of the recently restructured company probably represent a far better career opportunity tan if it were for a company that was cruising along quite successfully and quite comfortably,’ he says. ‘When companies are faced with challenges, there is the chance to make an impact, so the genuinely more exciting opportunities may well be with a company recruiting after restructure.’
Marsh says you should read every advertisement as a whole, trying to get feel for the overall flavour of the person required and the style of the organisation, rather than poring over every word and phrase. “You must also decide whether the type employer and the role appeal. If you’re not sure, do more research on the company. But most important, you must match the stated qualifications. I’m still amazed how many replies simply don’t meet the minimum requirements. Worse still, some candidates go through the whole process before considering the basics. To be offered the job and then say you don’t want to work in that town unforgivable and reflects badly on your own judgement. On the other hand, do not be deterred if the advertisement doesn’t give you all the information you might like. If details are left out – for example, employer identity or salary information – there will be good reasons for it, so don’t jump to conclusions.
Of course, the real trick is to be truly the ‘ideal candidate’, exactly matching all the requirements. In which casem you need to be selective, says Marsh. ‘Only apply for jibs where you can tick all the boxes. Job ads don’t tend to ask for an exhaustive list of requirements so, if you match the five stipulated criteria, create a CV and covering letter that explicitly demonstrates how you match each of those five. Better one such customised application than 20 standard CVs you sent off speculatively.
The bottom line is that the only jobs that are worth going for are those which are suitable for your core skills and Marsh points out, we all have only two or three things at which we truly excel. ‘Know what you’re outstandingly good at and focus on your applications based on those skills and you won’t go far wrong.’
1. One piece of advice Nick Marsh gives in the fourth paragraph is that
a. The absence of certain information should not be regarded with suspicion.
b. Employers are impressed it applicants have dobe research on their companies.
c. Location is a crucial factor when considering whether to accept an offer or not.
d. Studying adverts too closely can cause applicants to get the wrong impression.
2. In the fifth paragraph, Nick Marsh advises against
a. Making speculative job applications.
b. Exaggerating your suitability for a job.
c. Putting your own interpretation on a job advertisement.
d. Expecting to meet all the stated criteria.
3.What is meant in the context by the phrase ‘The bottom line’ (last paragraph)?
a. The minimum requirement
b. The final consideration
c. The most important point 
d. The unfortunate truth</h2><br />

I am applying for a position as Sales Manager with your company, as I feel my background in developing a sales department will be of interest to you.
As my resume indicates, I joined PT. Bakrie Electric., in the capacity of trainee and moved up the ladder to my current position of Sales Manager. In each year of my employment, I was successful in opening news account, penetrating existing ones, and reopening closed business. As a result, I was responsible for sales increase of 20% to 25%.
As sales manager I was involved in recruiting, training, and supervising a staff of 120 salespeople and was responsible for sales worldwide.
I am looking forward to meeting you. When can we set up an appointment for an interview? I may be reached at 021-7756729.

The impact of English might be immediate as a quick fix, but there are negative consequences for the longer-term development of a country and its people. Over the long-term it means widening the divide between those able to benefit fully from the education system and the opportunities that follow and those who are not, storing up social problems and limiting the contribution of vast numbers of people to the larger development aims.People in schools, families and governments in many countries know that the way language is handled in basic education is not working. They know that many children learn very little in school, and that one of the main reasons for achieving poorly or dropping out is not being able to understand or use the language of teaching and examinations. This effect is most dramatic where there is poverty and poor teaching quality.Children in these settings know this best of all, struggling through hours of classes trying to make a torrent of unfamiliar words make sense – or realising during an exam that they couldn't pass because they do not understand the questions. Some never go to school, knowing that their language and identity will not be welcome. These issues are estimated to affect 221 million school-aged children worldwide.The question now is how true multilingual education in Africa, Asia and Latin America can be made possible. The barriers are huge.This month the UK-based education and development charities CfBT and Save the Children publish joint research into work being done to spread mother tongue-based multilingual education projects across school systems. This has highlighted many of the problems, but also the most effective ways to make the change really happen.Our aim has been to identify the kind of approach that would create the right balance: respecting communities' rights to maintain and develop their own cultural identities and languages while also promoting strong skills across the curriculum and in "prestige languages" considered important for taking up economic and social opportunities.Our research focused on two well-developed multilingual education projects run by Save the Children with local partners in Vietnam and Bangladesh, as well as material from government-led projects in Andhra Pradesh and Orissa in India. Talking to teachers, NGO staff and academics, we found that a recurring theme was the fear, shared by government, school leadership and parents, that by reducing second language use in schools young people would become less skilled in languages that may have special status at regional, national or international levels.Local officials worry about implementing any policies without central approval. There are problems with recruiting teachers with mother tongue ability, and doubts over the cost of implementing complex multilingual systems. Ultimately the problem is the lack of demand from the top of education systems, only a concern with driving short-term economic improvement projects.The major reason for the failure of multilingual education programmes appears to be lack of understanding of their importance. Government and education leaders need to be presented with the evidence from pilot work, and from countries with similar contexts, that using the mother tongue as the medium of instruction for as long as possible at primary level, while gradually introducing a second language, helps students to acquire second language skills more quickly and effectively.Multilingual projects can also be hampered by rapid changes of education personnel while new approaches are tried and established. The development of clear guidelines for policy implementation and cascaded training will help address this.Success of multilingual schemes will be helped massively by finding and developing teachers who can use the children's language confidently. It is imperative to get speakers of minority or local languages into teaching wherever possible, and as soon as possible.Education and finance ministries should target resources at areas where data indicates that ethnicity and language is a key factor in poor school achievement and retention. In those areas local education authorities should be given autonomy over how they deliver education so that the</h2><br />
                        terjemahannya:Identifikasi collocations (VERB + ADJECTIVE) dalam paragraf berikut.<br /><br />Bulan ini dunia merayakan Hari Bahasa Ibu Bahasa Internasional - bukan hanya perayaan budaya dan adat istiadat, tetapi juga mengingatkan ketegangan saat ini terhadap bahasa dan pendidikan di negara-negara berkembang. Dan keunggulan bahasa Inggris sebagai lingua franca adalah inti masalah.<br /><br />Gagasan bahwa keterampilan bahasa Inggris adalah kunci untuk membuka akses ke pelatihan profesional, investasi, dan peluang bisnis adalah pandangan pendek. Dampak bahasa Inggris mungkin langsung sebagai perbaikan cepat, tetapi ada konsekuensi negatif untuk pembangunan jangka panjang suatu negara dan rakyatnya. Dalam jangka panjang, itu berarti memperluas kesenjangan antara mereka yang dapat memperoleh manfaat sepenuhnya dari sistem pendidikan dan peluang yang mengikuti dan mereka yang tidak, menyimpan masalah sosial dan membatasi kontribusi sejumlah besar orang ke tujuan pembangunan yang lebih besar.<br /><br />Orang-orang di sekolah, keluarga, dan pemerintah di banyak negara tahu bahwa cara bahasa ditangani dalam pendidikan dasar tidak berfungsi. Mereka tahu bahwa banyak anak belajar sangat sedikit di sekolah, dan bahwa salah satu alasan utama untuk mencapai buruk atau putus sekolah adalah tidak mampu memahami atau menggunakan bahasa pengajaran dan ujian. Efek ini paling dramatis di mana ada kemiskinan dan kualitas pengajaran yang buruk.<br /><br />Anak-anak dalam pengaturan ini tahu yang terbaik dari semua ini, berjuang melalui berjam-jam kelas mencoba membuat semburan kata-kata asing masuk akal - atau menyadari selama ujian yang tidak bisa mereka lewati karena mereka tidak memahami pertanyaan. Beberapa tidak pernah pergi ke sekolah, mengetahui bahwa bahasa dan identitas mereka tidak akan diterima. Masalah-masalah ini diperkirakan mempengaruhi 221 juta anak usia sekolah di seluruh dunia.<br /><br />Pertanyaannya sekarang adalah bagaimana pendidikan multibahasa yang benar di Afrika, Asia, dan Amerika Latin dapat dimungkinkan. Hambatannya sangat besar.<br /><br />Bulan ini pendidikan dan pengembangan amal berbasis di Inggris CfBT dan Save the Children mempublikasikan penelitian bersama ke dalam pekerjaan yang sedang dilakukan untuk menyebarkan proyek pendidikan multibahasa berbasis bahasa ibu di seluruh sistem sekolah. Ini telah menyoroti banyak masalah, tetapi juga cara paling efektif untuk membuat perubahan benar-benar terjadi.<br /><br />Tujuan kami adalah untuk mengidentifikasi jenis pendekatan yang akan menciptakan keseimbangan yang tepat: menghormati hak masyarakat untuk mempertahankan dan mengembangkan identitas budaya dan bahasa mereka sendiri sementara juga mempromosikan keterampilan yang kuat di seluruh kurikulum dan dalam "bahasa prestise" dianggap penting untuk mengambil peluang ekonomi dan sosial.<br /><br />Penelitian kami berfokus pada dua proyek pendidikan multibahasa yang dikembangkan dengan baik oleh Save the Children dengan mitra lokal di Vietnam dan Bangladesh, serta materi dari proyek-proyek yang dipimpin pemerintah di Andhra Pradesh dan Orissa di India. Berbicara kepada guru, staf LSM, dan akademisi, kami menemukan bahwa tema yang berulang adalah rasa takut, yang dibagikan oleh pemerintah, kepemimpinan sekolah dan orang tua, bahwa dengan mengurangi penggunaan bahasa kedua di sekolah, anak-anak muda akan menjadi kurang terampil dalam bahasa yang mungkin memiliki status khusus di tingkat regional, nasional atau internasional.<br /><br />Pejabat lokal khawatir tentang menerapkan kebijakan apa pun tanpa persetujuan pusat. Ada masalah dengan merekrut guru dengan kemampuan bahasa ibu, dan meragukan biaya penerapan sistem multibahasa yang kompleks. Pada akhirnya masalahnya adalah kurangnya permintaan dari puncak sistem pendidikan, hanya masalah dengan mendorong proyek-proyek peningkatan ekonomi jangka pendek.<br /><br />Alasan utama kegagalan program pendidikan multibahasa tampaknya adalah kurangnya pemahaman akan pentingnya mereka. Pemerintah dan pemimpin pendidikan perlu untuk disajikan dengan bukti dari pekerjaan percontohan, dan dari negara-negara dengan konteks yang sama, yang menggunakan bahasa ibu sebagai media instruksi selama mungkin di tingkat dasar, sementara secara bertahap memperkenalkan bahasa kedua, membantu siswa untuk memperoleh keterampilan bahasa kedua lebih cepat dan efektif.<br /><br />Proyek multilingual juga dapat terhambat oleh perubahan cepat dari tenaga kependidikan sementara pendekatan baru dicoba dan ditetapkan. Pengembangan pedoman yang jelas untuk implementasi kebijakan dan pelatihan yang mengalir akan membantu mengatasi hal ini.<br /><br />Keberhasilan skema multibahasa akan sangat terbantu dengan menemukan dan mengembangkan guru yang dapat menggunakan bahasa anak-anak dengan percaya diri. Sangat penting untuk mendapatkan pembicara dari minoritas atau bahasa lokal untuk mengajar sedapat mungkin, dan sesegera mungkin.<br /><br /><br />

 Di bawah ini adalah biografi seorang perawat Bulgaria yang melamar pekerjaan di United Kingdom. Gunakan informasi dalam biografi untuk menjawab pertanyaan setelahnya.
 When she was a child, Rosita wanted to be a doctor not a nurse born on 1st July 1973 in Plovdiv. Her first memories are of playing “doctor “ – her favourite game. First She use her dolls as patients and later she used her friends while her father lounging in front of the TV set, Rosita would bandage his arm and legs and pop a thermometer into his mouth.
 After primary school, there followed four years at 27 secondary school Vazov. Rosita worked hard but she didn’t like academic work and so did not do well enough to became a doctor. However, she scored an average of 5 in the diploma of completed secondary education and this was enough for her to get into the Medical University in Sofia in 1992 to take a BSc degree in nursing.
 While she was studying, she fell in love with a medical student called Ilya botched. They had a short romance and married in 1994. In some ways it was a mistake, a year later, Ilya left to work in Syria, fell in love with someone else while he was there and on January 15th May 1996 Ilya and Rosita was discovered. Rosita was pregnant where Ilya left for Africa and on 14th 1995, she had a son, Ivan. Rosita kept her married name.
Rosita’s first job was at the Pirogue Emergency hospital in Sofia. She stays for two years, getting as much experience as possible and also extending her qualifications with a Certificate in Orthopaedic Nursing. She also studied English in her spare time and in October 1997 she passed the Cambridge FCE. She left the Pirogue in November 1997 and took up a post as staff nurse at the Aleksandrovsk Hospital. She also moved into a new flat at number, Gurov street Sofia 1602.
All this time, Ivan was growing up. It was difficult for Rosita to be a mother and have a career. Money was tight and, when she heard that UK NHS trusts were recruiting nurses from outside the UK, she decided to apply for a job.
Her sisters was already in England and, besides, Rosita wanted to leave behind unhappy memories, and make a fresh start. She decided that if she got a job there, she would go alone, settle and sent for Ivan later.

                            28. Bantuin tugas sekolah saya ya...
Ever noticed how the whole of the recruitment world seems to speak in code? Take one recent example: ‘Our client is prestigious (translation: arrogant and self-serving), recently restructured (downsized) company seeking to recruit (hello, that downsizing went a bit too far) a self-motivated (you’ll be on your own), hands-on (you’ll get no support), ambitious (24/7 is your world) business development (sales) director (the lower case ‘d’ means you won’t be on the board).’
Look closely at job advertising and you will find plenty pure rubbish too: a salary described as ‘circa $32,245’ (the implication being, presumably, that you could argue over the pence) pr, to quote from an ad for a communication director. ‘the successful candidate must have the proven ability to demonstrate the facility to exhibit a range of excellent communications skill – clearly necessary as the writer couldn’t.
Hidden away in all this code is the challenge to find which jobs you should apply for “The first rule of thumb is that you need to be at least “90%” there in meeting the minimum advertised requirements.’ Say Nick Marsh of recruiters Odgers International. An Important part the decoding is being able to spot an opportunity where you are needed and your skills are valued, ‘Oddly enough, your example of the recently restructured company probably represent a far better career opportunity tan if it were for a company that was cruising along quite successfully and quite comfortably,’ he says. ‘When companies are faced with challenges, there is the chance to make an impact, so the genuinely more exciting opportunities may well be with a company recruiting after restructure.’
Marsh says you should read every advertisement as a whole, trying to get feel for the overall flavour of the person required and the style of the organisation, rather than poring over every word and phrase. “You must also decide whether the type employer and the role appeal. If you’re not sure, do more research on the company. But most important, you must match the stated qualifications. I’m still amazed how many replies simply don’t meet the minimum requirements. Worse still, some candidates go through the whole process before considering the basics. To be offered the job and then say you don’t want to work in that town unforgivable and reflects badly on your own judgement. On the other hand, do not be deterred if the advertisement doesn’t give you all the information you might like. If details are left out – for example, employer identity or salary information – there will be good reasons for it, so don’t jump to conclusions.
Of course, the real trick is to be truly the ‘ideal candidate’, exactly matching all the requirements. In which casem you need to be selective, says Marsh. ‘Only apply for jibs where you can tick all the boxes. Job ads don’t tend to ask for an exhaustive list of requirements so, if you match the five stipulated criteria, create a CV and covering letter that explicitly demonstrates how you match each of those five. Better one such customised application than 20 standard CVs you sent off speculatively.
The bottom line is that the only jobs that are worth going for are those which are suitable for your core skills and Marsh points out, we all have only two or three things at which we truly excel. ‘Know what you’re outstandingly good at and focus on your applications based on those skills and you won’t go far wrong.’
1. The writer’s aim in the first paragraph is to suggest that
a. Job advertisement should use simpler terms than they often do.
b. Certain terms have become fashionable in job advertisement.
c. The phrasing of many job advertisement is misleading.
d. Potential applicants should read job advertisements more carefully.
2. In the second paragraph, the writer refers to an advertisement that
a. Is open to various interpretations.
b. Is poorly phrased.
c. Exaggerates the requirements of the job.
d. Present information unlikely to be true.
3. In the third paragraph, Nick Marsh says that it can be a good idea to
a. Apply for jobs with companies that have a reputation for frequent change.
b. Look for companies whose recruitment policies are unusual.
c. Disregard some of what companies say in their job advertisements.
d. Apply to companies that may be seen as experiencing problems at the moments.</h2><br />
