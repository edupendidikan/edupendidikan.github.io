                                            Why People Move to Suburbs from Cities More and more people are deciding to move to suburbs. Is that surprising? Living in the suburbs has many unique perks which you can't enjoy living elsewhere. Suburbs are the perfect balance between experiencing urban and rural lives. The first is that people prefer less crowds. What makes a city is inevitable is the endless numbers of people in every corner. Cities are already congested with multiple buildings, cars, and taxis. No matter where you go in the city, you'll always find yourself trying to push through a huge crowd of people. However, suburbs are generally much less populated which means they are not nearly as crowded or congested. Many people leave the hectic crowds from the city and move to the suburbs to enjoy some peace when walking on the streets. Second, if you are someone who is fond of nature, then the suburbs are for you. In the city, you'd be lucky to spot more than a few trees and bushes. On the other hand, the suburbs are thriving with nature. Suburbs never run short of beautiful mountains, rivers, lakes, forests, and parks. Here you will find vast stretches of greenery and open land that will give you a breath of fresh air. In addition, suburbs are also home to more wildlife species than the city which indicates that you'd be living in a healthy and wholesome ecosystem. The abundance of nature brings with it fun activities, such as fishing, hiking, zip-lining, and boating. Then, city residents look to move into a suburban area to gain a sense of community. In a city, it's incredibly hard to build friendships with the people surrounding you. By living in suburbs, you will benefit from a quality social life. You can have close-knit relationships with your neighbors and build your own interpersonal community. Having good friends and neighbors is not only fun for those Thanksgiving dinners, but is also a very important aspect of feeling safe and more at home.1.identify the generic structure of the text 2.underline verba.in present tense fromb.in passive voice from3.look for the conjunction of the text mohon bantuannya ya! nanti mau dikumpulin​</a>

A secondary effect of traffic congestion is the inability to estimate travel times.Those who regularly travel congested areas know approximately how long it usually takes to get through a particular area depending on the time of they or the they of the week.  The stopping and starting in traffic jams bums fuel at a higher rate than the smooth rate of a travel on the open highway this increase in fuel consumption costs commuters additional money for fuel and it also contributes to the amount of emissions released by the vehicles.These emission create pollution and are related to global warming9.why does a traffic congestion make people upset in the morning?A.they may late to workB.they cannot arrive home earlyC.the fuel emission increases air pollutionD.they fuel emission causes global warmingE.they need more money for excessive fuel consumption10.ahat should people do to avoid rush hours?A.wake up earlyB.drive private earsC.ride a motorcycleD.go to work earlierE.save fuel consumption11.from the text we know that...A.people may enjoy traffic congestionB.traffic jams can raduce fuel emissionC.being stuck in traffic jams is relaxing D.traffic jams may lengthen people's relax timeE.it is difficult to estimate the travel time because of traffic jamstolong bantu​</a>

What you may not realize is the extent of the effects heavy traffic congestion can have. This gridlock can have a tremendous impact on your personal life, career, your future and even your safety. 
          The first thing many people think of when it comes to congested roadways is the delay. During the morning commute there is additional stress because delays caused by traffic can make people late for work. And at the end of the day, the afternoon rush hour is again a frustrating time because the workday is done and people want to get home to relax, but the traffic prevents that.
           A secondary effect of traffic congestion is the inability to estimate travel times. Those who regularly travel congested areas know approximately how long it usually takes to get through a particular area depending on the time of day or the day of the week.
           The stopping and starting in traffic jams burns fuel at a higher rate than the smooth rate of travel on the open highway. This increase in fuel consumption costs commuters additional money for fuel and it also contributes to the amount of emissions released by the vehicles. These emissions create air pollution and are related to global warming.
9. Why does a traffic congestion make people upset in the morning?
 A. They may be late to work
 B. They cannot arrive home early
 C. The fuel emission increases air pollution
 D. The fuel emission causes global warming
 E. They need more money for excessive fuel consumption.
10. What should people do to avoid rush hours?
 A. Wake up early
 B. Drive private cars
 C. Ride a motorcycle
 D. Go to work earlier
 E. Save fuel consumption
11. From the text we know that _____________
 A. people may enjoy traffic congestion
 B. traffic jams can reduce fuel emission
 C. being stuck in traffic jams is relaxing
 D. traffis jams may lengthen people's relax time
 E. it is difficult to estimate the travel time because of traffic jams</a>

                                            mohon bantuannya !mohon bantuannya!mau dikumpulkan !More and more people are deciding to move to suburbs. Is that surprising? Living in the suburbs has many unique perks which you can't enjoy living elsewhere. Suburbs are the perfect balance between experiencing urban and rural lives. The first is that people prefer less crowds. What makes a city is inevitable is the endless numbers of people in every corner. Cities are already congested with multiple buildings, cars, and taxis. No matter where you go in the city, you'll always find yourself trying to push through a huge crowd of people. However, suburbs are generally much less populated which means they are not nearly as crowded or congested. Many people leave the hectic crowds from the city and move to the suburbs to enjoy some peace when walking on the streets. Second, if you are someone who is fond of nature, then the suburbs are for you. In the city, you'd be lucky to spot more than a few trees and bushes. On the other hand, the suburbs are thriving with nature. Suburbs never run short of beautiful mountains, rivers, lakes, forests, and parks. Here you will find vast stretches of greenery and open land that will give you a breath of fresh air. In addition, suburbs are also home to more wildlife species than the city which indicates that you'd be living in a healthy and wholesome ecosystem. The abundance of nature brings with it fun activities, such as fishing, hiking, zip-lining, and boating. Then, city residents look to move into a suburban area to gain a sense of community. In a city, it's incredibly hard to build friendships with the people surrounding you. By living in suburbs, you will benefit from a quality social life. You can have close-knit relationships with your neighbors and build your own interpersonal community. Having good friends and neighbors is not only fun for those Thanksgiving dinners, but is also a very important aspect of feeling safe and more at home.1.identify the generic structure of the text2.underline verba.in present tense formb.in passive voice form3.look for the conjuction of the textterima kasih, mohon bantuannya sekali lagi ​</a>

                            5. Why People Move to Suburbs from Cities More and more people are deciding to move to suburbs. Is that surprising? Living in the suburbs has many unique perks which you can't enjoy living elsewhere. Suburbs are the perfect balance between experiencing urban and rural lives. The first is that people prefer less crowds. What makes a city is inevitable is the endless numbers of people in every corner. Cities are already congested with multiple buildings, cars, and taxis. No matter where you go in the city, you'll always find yourself trying to push through a huge crowd of people. However, suburbs are generally much less populated which means they are not nearly as crowded or congested. Many people leave the hectic crowds from the city and move to the suburbs to enjoy some peace when walking on the streets. Second, if you are someone who is fond of nature, then the suburbs are for you. In the city, you'd be lucky to spot more than a few trees and bushes. On the other hand, the suburbs are thriving with nature. Suburbs never run short of beautiful mountains, rivers, lakes, forests, and parks. Here you will find vast stretches of greenery and open land that will give you a breath of fresh air. In addition, suburbs are also home to more wildlife species than the city which indicates that you'd be living in a healthy and wholesome ecosystem. The abundance of nature brings with it fun activities, such as fishing, hiking, zip-lining, and boating. Then, city residents look to move into a suburban area to gain a sense of community. In a city, it's incredibly hard to build friendships with the people surrounding you. By living in suburbs, you will benefit from a quality social life. You can have close-knit relationships with your neighbors and build your own interpersonal community. Having good friends and neighbors is not only fun for those Thanksgiving dinners, but is also a very important aspect of feeling safe and more at home.1.identify the generic structure of the text 2.underline verba.in present tense fromb.in passive voice from3.look for the conjunction of the text mohon bantuannya ya! nanti mau dikumpulin​</h2><br />

                            9.           If you live in a large city or any area where there are lots of commuters on the road, you are probably familiar with the traffic congestion. What you may not realize is the extent of the effects heavy traffic congestion can have. This gridlock can have a tremendous impact on your personal life, career, your future and even your safety. 
          The first thing many people think of when it comes to congested roadways is the delay. During the morning commute there is additional stress because delays caused by traffic can make people late for work. And at the end of the day, the afternoon rush hour is again a frustrating time because the workday is done and people want to get home to relax, but the traffic prevents that.
           A secondary effect of traffic congestion is the inability to estimate travel times. Those who regularly travel congested areas know approximately how long it usually takes to get through a particular area depending on the time of day or the day of the week.
           The stopping and starting in traffic jams burns fuel at a higher rate than the smooth rate of travel on the open highway. This increase in fuel consumption costs commuters additional money for fuel and it also contributes to the amount of emissions released by the vehicles. These emissions create air pollution and are related to global warming.

                            16. Why People Move to Suburbs from Cities More and more people are deciding to move to suburbs. Is that surprising? Living in the suburbs has many unique perks which you can't enjoy living elsewhere. Suburbs are the perfect balance between experiencing urban and rural lives. The first is that people prefer less crowds. What makes a city is inevitable is the endless numbers of people in every corner. Cities are already congested with multiple buildings, cars, and taxis. No matter where you go in the city, you'll always find yourself trying to push through a huge crowd of people. However, suburbs are generally much less populated which means they are not nearly as crowded or congested. Many people leave the hectic crowds from the city and move to the suburbs to enjoy some peace when walking on the streets. Second, if you are someone who is fond of nature, then the suburbs are for you. In the city, you'd be lucky to spot more than a few trees and bushes. On the other hand, the suburbs are thriving with nature. Suburbs never run short of beautiful mountains, rivers, lakes, forests, and parks. Here you will find vast stretches of greenery and open land that will give you a breath of fresh air. In addition, suburbs are also home to more wildlife species than the city which indicates that you'd be living in a healthy and wholesome ecosystem. The abundance of nature brings with it fun activities, such as fishing, hiking, zip-lining, and boating. Then, city residents look to move into a suburban area to gain a sense of community. In a city, it's incredibly hard to build friendships with the people surrounding you. By living in suburbs, you will benefit from a quality social life. You can have close-knit relationships with your neighbors and build your own interpersonal community. Having good friends and neighbors is not only fun for those Thanksgiving dinners, but is also a very important aspect of feeling safe and more at home.
