                                            No student of a foreign language needs to be told that grammar is complex. By changingword sequences and by adding a range of auxiliary verbs and suffixes, we are able tocommunicate tiny variations in meaning. We can turn a statement into a question, statewhether an action has taken place or is soon to take place, and perform many other word tricksto convey subtle differences in meaning. Nor is this complexity inherent to the Englishlanguage. All languages, even those of so-called 'primitive tribes have clever grammaticalcomponents. The Cherokee pronoun system, for example, can distinguish between you and I','several other people and I' and 'you, another person and I'. In English, all these aresummed up in the one, crude pronoun 'we'. Grammar is universal and plays a part in everylanguage, no matter how widespread it is.

                                            Pigeons have been taught to recognize human facial
expressions, upsetting long-held beliefs that only humans
had evolved the sophisticated nervous systems to perform
such a feat In recent experiments at the University of Iowa,
eight trained pigeons were shown photographs of people
displaying emotions of happiness, anger, surprise, and
disgust, The birds learned to distinguish between these
expressions. Not only that, but they were also able to correctly
identify the same expressions on photographs of
unfamiliar faces. Their achievement does not suggest,
of course, that the pigeons had any idea what the human
expressions meant
Some psychologists have theorized that because of
the importance of facial expression to human
communication, humans developed special nervous systems
capable of recognizing subtle expressions. The pigeons cast
doubt on that idea, however,
In fact, the ability to recognize facial expressions of
emotion is not necessarily innate even in human babies, but
may have to be learned in much the same way pigeons
learn, in experiments conducted several years ago at
the University of Iowa, it was found that pigeons organize
images of things into the same logical categories that
humans do
None of this work would come as any surprise to
Charles Darwin, who long ago wrote about the continuity of
mental development from animals to humans,

about pigeons?

O a. They can show the same emotions humans can
O b. They can understand human emotions,
O c. They can only identify the expressions of people they

                                            CARILAH IDE" POKOK TEKS DI BAWAH INIPolitics in the age of media convergence differs from a few decades ago.Citizens now have more outlets in expressing their thought by utilizing social media and messaging apps to respond to the news and give unsolicited commentaries on the most-debated subject in political affairs.  The use of hashtags and memes are prevalent. The meme is described by the academic Limor Shifman as a digital and user-generated content comprising one or a combined element of multimedia items.The basic ingredients of meme could be a simple picture of renowned persons edited anonymously, often with a short text or conversation bubble. This ranges from the making of a picture of lawmakers, top politicians, ministers or presidents, featuring their unique and signature facial expressions which are digitally edited and cluttered with funny or satirical message to a short clip, whose dubbing and subtitles are altered to serve a certain purpose.The meme circulating across social media timelines signifies public creativity, resulting from cyber activism and increased voluntary engagement by citizens in the public narrative, thanks to the widespread ownership of handheld gadgets.Indonesian netizen’s eagerness in using social media reflects the nation’s culture of participation in the digital era. In early 2017, Twitter reported Indonesia was the fifth country of Twitter users, with some  4.1 billion tweets sent from the country. Both trends indicate a high degree of activity and intense flow of online (accessible) content which at any rates are searchable worldwide through tracking a line of hashtag.The apparent fondness of engaging in public debate and reacting to the political narrative via social media substantiates a premise that highly political matter is not only a theme of discussion raised by high-profile policy makers, but cascading down to everyday conversation among ordinary citizens.  This reality is nevertheless susceptible to the irresponsible and derogatory content attributable to meme’s anonymous nature.Some years ago,  ideas or aspirations were best presented by the pressure of interest groups, political parties or  fractions in the legislature largely due to their ingrained power in persuading and mobilizing the masses. With the advent of digital communication the origin of social change initially driven by ideas is no longer sourced from the formal, hierarchical and structured institution. Instead, internet has capacitated individuals to pitch their own opinion, initiate a movement, and land themselves in a circumstance equally influential to that of formal political forces.Internet memes feed the cyberspace with ideas, a subtle movement, and political campaign. Meme diffusion which  easily escalates from a content merely shared by an individual to an item rapidly consumed by masses, highlights an important feature of broad reachability and friendliness to all segments of society, which is essential for political framing. As noted by Shifman, memes encapsulate a pot of ideas, communicative technique, and textually powerful social interaction.The researchers Colin Lankshear and Michele Knobel take memes even more seriously; though meme’s coverage is at the micro level (individual-to-individual), its repercussion is larger than its scope of diffusion. It can shape mindsets, social behavior and attitudes of numerous social groups.Meme functions as a presenter of ideas that conceals or clearly pitches a subjective interest.Take a viral meme created on Susi Pudjiastuti, the popular Fisheries and Marine Affairs Minister. Her campaign on consuming fish for a healthy diet is made into a meme with a twist on her campaign against illegal fishing: “… anyone who doesn’t eat fish, I will sink them”. A jargon, tagline, motto, and a short quote on a picture sums up a key message  at the end.The underlying issue of market sustainability in fisheries is a complex process involving supply and demand balancing effort, national purchasing power, and maritime culture cultivation that entails problem solving. One solution is promoting fish consumption across the nation, also for the population’s health. Indeed, the promotion is at the heart of government’s interest, which received huge public response. Susi’s popularity appeared to increase; the meme seemed to have successfully helped the government policy in promoting fish consumption.Meme flourishes because it benefits from internet penetration and regular use of social networking sites: shareability and readability. Passing a meme to others is not burdensome. Meanwhile an immense degree of readability occurs when even the most digitally-illiterate people can still access the meaning ascribed to a meme. Both aspects have made meme popularly circulated amongst citizens.</a>

(1) Developing complex skills in the classroom involves the key ingredients identified in teaching pigeons to play ping-pong and to bowl. (2) The key ingredients are:  inducing a response; reinforcing subtle improvements or refinements in the behavior; providing for the transfer of stimulus control by gradually withdrawing the prompts or cues; and scheduling reinforcements so that the ratio of reinforcements in responses gradually increases and natural reinforcers can maintain their behavior.

                                            Tips For Becoming An Engaged Listener  Focus fully on the speaker. You can’t listen in an engaged way if you’re constantly checking your phone or thinking about something else. You need to stay focused on the moment-to-moment experience in order to pick up the subtle nuances and important nonverbal cues in a conversation. If you find it hard to concentrate on some speakers, try repeating their words over in your head—it’ll reinforce their message and help you stay focused. Favor your right ear. As strange as it sounds, the left side of the brain contains the primary processing centers for both speech comprehension and emotions. Since the left side of the brain is connected to the right side of the body, favoring your right ear can help you better detect the emotional nuances of what someone is saying. Avoid interrupting or trying to redirect the conversation to your concerns. By saying something like, “If you think that’s bad, let me tell you what happened to me.” Listening is not the same as waiting for your turn to talk. You can’t concentrate on what someone’s saying if you’re forming what you’re going to say next. Often, the speaker can read your facial expressions and know that your mind’s elsewhere. Show your interest in what’s being said. Nod occasionally, smile at the person, and make sure your posture is open and inviting. Encourage the speaker to continue with small verbal comments like “yes” or “uh huh.” Try to set aside judgment. In order to communicate effectively with someone, you don’t have to like them or agree with their ideas, values, or opinions. However, you do need to set aside your judgment and withhold blame and criticism in order to fully understand them. The most difficult communication, when successfully executed, can often lead to an unlikely connection with someone.  Read the text above and analyze based on the questions.  1.

But what are the traditional Saudi dishes like?     Saudi cuisine is strongly influenced by the kingdom's nomadic past. The Bedouin tribes were goat and sheep herders who relied on their livestock for meat, milk, and cheese. Traditional Saudi dishes are mostly based on meat, rice, and spices. The most common meat eaten is chicken; lamb is a common choice when entertaining honored guests, and camel is served on special occasions. According to Islamic law, the consumption of pork is prohibited, as is alcohol.     Traditional Saudi cuisine makes use of beans, wheat, rice, yogurt and of course dates. Saudis are self-sufficient in wheat production and export it to dozens of countries. The farmers also grow substantial amounts of barley, sorghum and millet. Flat breads, or tameez, similar to a pita, are inexpensive and used to scoop up their meals.     Most of the fruit and vegetables are imported but Saudis grow watermelon, citrus fruits, squash, tomatoes and onion. Spices such as cardamom, saffron, cumin, coriander, cinnamon and cloves are also prevalent in the traditional Saudi dishes.     Saudi Arabia has over 25 million date palms and dates are a staple food in the kingdom. Not only are they eaten on their own but dates are also a common ingredient in local dishes. Dates are important during Ramadan, when they are traditionally eaten every evening to break the fast.     Saudi meals start with gahwa, or coffee, and dates, followed by sweet tea. Only then is dinner served. After dinner, coffee, dates and finally sweet tea is served again. The entire meal takes hours and may last until the early hours of the morning.TRADITIONAL SAUDI DISHES- KABSA –  Kabsa is considered a national dish of Saudi Arabia, even though it is also enjoyed throughout the Arabian Peninsula, known as machboos.     The dish is similar to Persian and Indian biryanis—long-grain rice cooked in heavily spiced stock, topped with chicken, lamb, or camel meat. It can also be served with fish or shrimp.     Kabsa is served on a large platter, meant to be shared and eaten by hands (always a right hand).- JAREESH -
 Jareesh is crushed whole wheat cooked in milk and garnished with crispy cooked onions and lime.The dried limes are the secret ingredient in Saudi and Middle-Eastern cooking. These small dry balls can be dropped whole in a pot or pierced with a fork to get a few drops of juice out.  In the Middle East, these limes are most often added whole to soups and stews. They add a pleasant tang and a subtle complexity to the entire dish.- MATAZEEZ -  Matazeez is a rich stew of meat, vegetables, tomato sauce, and spices with whole-wheat dumplings cut into egg-sized piece, flattened, and then placed inside the pot.The most common meat is lamb and the dish can include a combination of vegetables such as carrots, onions, cauliflower, eggplant.The most common mix of spices is cumin, cinnamon and loomi (dried limes), cardamon, cloves, and nutmeg. The dish is similar to margoog but less soupy in consistency.- SALEEG -
Saleeg is a rice dish consisting of creamy short-grain rice topped with roasted meat. The rice is boiled in water and then combined with milk and ghee or butter, and cooked until it reaches the desired consistency.The dish is usually served on a large serving platter, tabasi, with a spicy, salsa-like salsa, lemon wedges, or a chopped tomato-cucumber-carrot salad.- EATING SAUDI STYLE -     Every gathering starts with gahwa and tea, both are always made in front of the dinner guests and it is impolite to refuse it. Most Saudi homes have a sitting room with carpets on the floor and cushions against the wall for social gatherings. There is usually a stove or fireplace to prepare the coffee and tea.Hands are washed before and after eating. In restaurants it is common to bring a wet napkin in the end of the meal. The tradition is to eat on the floor in a cross-legged position. Food platters are placed on a table cloth or a cover made of dried palm leaves. Saudis use their right hands to eat and keeping the left hand on the table is not acceptable, as is passing food with the left hand. Saudis are known for their generosity and food is abundant when entertaining guests. The dinner guests leave some foods on the plate indicating that the host has offered plenty of foods.In Riyadh, the best place to experience the traditional Saudi dishes is at Najd Village.​</a>

Meme diffusion which  easily escalates from a content merely shared by an individual to an item rapidly consumed by masses, highlights an important feature of broad reachability and friendliness to all segments of society, which is essential for political framing. As noted by Shifman, memes encapsulate a pot of ideas, communicative technique, and textually powerful social interaction.</a>

                                            Terjemahin dong kak :)For 2.5 million years the Earth climate has fluctuated, cycling from ice ages to warmer periods.But in the last century, the planet temperature has risen unusually fastabout 1.2 to 1.4 degrees Fahrenheit.Scientists believe it’s human activity that's driving the temperatures up,a process known as global warming.Ever since the industrial revolution began, factories, power plants and eventually cars have burnt fossil fuels such as oil and coal, releasing huge amounts of carbon dioxide and other gases into the atmosphere.These greenhouse gases trap heat near the earth in a naturally occurring process called the greenhouse effect.The greenhouse effect begins with the sun and the energy it radiates to the Earth.The Earth and the atmosphere absorb some of this energy while the rest is radiated back into space.Naturally occurring gases in the atmosphere trap some of this energy and reflect it back, warming the Earth. Scientists now believe that the greenhouse effect is being intensified by the extra greenhouse gases that humans have released.Evidence for global warming includes a recent string of very warm years.Scientists report that 1998 was the warmest year in measured history with 2005 coming in second, meanwhile readings taken from ice coresshow that the greenhouse gases, carbon dioxide and methane have hit their highest levels in the past 420 000 years.Arctic sea ice is also shrinking. According to NASA studies the extent of arctic sea ice has declined about 10% in the last thirty years.As long as industrialized nations consume energy and developing countries increase their fossil fuel consumption, the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere will continue to rise.Researchers predict that temperatures will increase about two to ten degrees Fahrenheit by the end of the century.What’s less certain is what rising temperatures mean for the planet.Some climate models predict subtle changes, others forecast rising sea levels which could flood coastal areas around the world.Weather patterns could change, making hurricanes more frequent.Severe droughts could become more common in warm areas and species unable to adapt to changing conditions would face extinction.Although much remains to be learned about global warming, many organizations advocate cutting greenhouse gas emissions to reduce theimpact of global warming.Consumers can help by saving energy around the house, switching to compact fluorescent light bulbs and driving fewer miles in their cars each week.These simple changes may help keep the Earth cooler in the future.​</a>

Question 1-11 There are two basic types of glaciers, those that ﬂow outward in all directions with little regard for any underlying terrain and those that are conﬁned by terrain to a particular path.  The ﬁrst category of glaciers includes those massive blankets that cover whole continents, appropriately called ice sheets. There must be over 50,000 square kilometers of land covered with ice for the glacier to qualify as an ice sheet. When portions of an ice sheet spread out over the ocean, they form ice shelves.  About 20,000 years ago the Cordilleran Ice Sheet covered nearly all the mountains in southern Alaska, western Canada, and the western United States. It was about 3 kilometers deep at its thickest point in northern Alberta. Now there are only two sheets left on Earth, those covering Greenland and Antarctica.  Any domelike body of ice that also ﬂows out in all directions but covers less than 50,000 square kilometers is called an ice cap. Although ice caps are rare nowadays, there are a number in northeastern Canada, on Baﬃn Island, and on the Queen Elizabeth Islands. The second category of glaciers includes those of a variety of shapes and sizes generally called mountain or alpine glaciers. Mountain glaciers are typically identiﬁed by the landform that controls their ﬂow. One form of mountain glacier that resembles an ice cap in that it ﬂows outward in several directions is called an ice ﬁeld. The difference between an ice ﬁeld and an ice cap is subtle. Essentially, the ﬂow of an ice ﬁeld is somewhat controlled by surrounding terrain and thus does not have the domelike shape of a cap. There are several ice ﬁelds in the Wrangell. St. Elias, and Chugach mountains of Alaska and northern British Columbia.  Less spectacular than large ice ﬁelds are the most common types of mountain glaciers: the cirque and valley glaciers. Cirque glaciers are found in depressions in the surface of the land and have a characteristic circular shape. The ice of valley glaciers, bound by terrain, ﬂows down valleys, curves around their corners, and falls over cliffs.</a>

                                            I need help to summarize this passage. I give you 10 points if you could help meNo student of a foreign language needs to be told that grammar is complex.  By changing word sequences and by adding a range of auxiliary verbs and suffixes, we are able to communicate tiny variations in meaning.  We can turn a statement into a question, state whether an action has taken place or is soon to take place, and perform many other word tricks to convey subtle differences in meaning.  Nor is this complexity inherent to the English language.  All languages, even those of so-called 'primitive' tribes have clever grammatical components.  The Cherokee pronoun system, for example, can distinguish between 'you and I', 'several other people and I' and 'you, another person and I'.  In English, all these meanings are summed up in the one, crude pronoun 'we'.  Grammar is universal and plays a part in every language, no matter how widespread it is.  So the question which has baffled many linguists is - who created grammar? At first, it would appear that this question is impossible to answer.  To find out how grammar is created, someone needs to be present at the time of a language's creation, documenting its emergence.  Many historical linguists are able to trace modern complex languages back to earlier languages, but in order to answer the question of how complex languages are actually formed, the researcher needs to observe how languages are started from scratch.  Amazingly, however, this is possible.Some of the most recent languages evolved due to the Atlantic slave trade.  At that time, slaves from a number of different ethnicities were forced to work together under colonizer's rule.  Since they had no opportunity to learn each other's languages, they developed a make-shift language called a pidgin.  Pidgins are strings of words copied from the language of the landowner.  They have little in the way of grammar, and in many cases it is difficult for a listener to deduce when an event happened, and who did what to whom. Speakers need to use circumlocution in order to make their meaning understood. Interestingly, however, all it takes for a pidgin to become a complex language is for a group of children to be exposed to it at the time when they learn their mother tongue. Slave children did not simply copy the strings of words uttered by their elders, they adapted their words to create a new, expressive language. Complex grammar systems which emerge from pidgins are termed creoles, and they are invented by children.Further evidence of this can be seen in studying sign languages for the deaf.  Sign languages are not simply a series of gestures; they utilize the same grammatical machinery that is found in spoken languages.  Moreover, there are many different languages used worldwide. The creation of one such language was documented quite recently in Nicaragua. Previously, all deaf people were isolated from each other, but in 1979 a new government introduced schools for the deaf.  Although children were taught speech and lip reading in the classroom, in the playgrounds they began to invent their own sign system, using the gestures that they used at home.  It was basically a pidgin.  Each child used the signs differently, and there was no consistent grammar.  However, children who joined the school later, when this inventive sign system was already around, developed a quite different sign language.  Although it was based on the signs of the older children, the younger children's language was more fluid and compact, and it utilised a large range of grammatical devices to clarify meaning.  What is more, all the children used the signs in the same way.  A new creole was born. Some linguists believe that many of the world's most established languages were creoles at first.  The English past tense –ed ending may have evolved from the verb 'do'.  'It ended' may once have been 'It end-did'.  Therefore it would appear that even the most widespread languages were partly created by children.  Children appear to have innate grammatical machinery in their brains, which springs to life when they are first trying to make sense of the world around them.  Their minds can serve to create logical, complex structures, even when there is no grammar present for them to copy.</a>

                                            There stood, facing the open window, a comfortable, roomy armchair. Into this she sank, pressed down by a physical exhaustion that haunted her body and seemed to reach into her soul.  She could see in the open square before her house the tops of trees that were all aquiver with the new spring life. The delicious breath of rain was in the air. In the street below a peddler was crying his wares. The notes of a distant song which some one was singing reached her faintly, and countless sparrows were twittering in the eaves.  There were patches of blue sky showing here and there through the clouds that had met and piled one above the other in the west facing her window.  She sat with her head thrown back upon the cushion of the chair, quite motionless, except when a sob came up into her throat and shook her, as a child who has cried itself to sleep continues to sob in its dreams.  She was young, with a fair, calm face, whose lines bespoke repression and even a certain strength. But now there was a dull stare in her eyes, whose gaze was fixed away off yonder on one of those patches of blue sky. It was not a glance of reflection, but rather indicated a suspension of intelligent thought.  There was something coming to her and she was waiting for it, fearfully. What was it? She did not know; it was too subtle and elusive to name. But she felt it, creeping out of the sky, reaching toward her through the sounds, the scents, the color that filled the air.  Now her bosom rose and fell tumultuously. She was beginning to recognize this thing that was approaching to possess her, and she was striving to beat it back with her will—as powerless as her two white slender hands would have been.  When she abandoned herself a little whispered word escaped her slightly parted lips. She said it over and over under her breath: “free, free, free!” The vacant stare and the look of terror that had followed it went from her eyes. They stayed keen and bright. Her pulses beat fast, and the coursing blood warmed and relaxed every inch of her body.  She did not stop to ask if it were or were not a monstrous joy that held her. A clear and exalted perception enabled her to dismiss the suggestion as trivial.  She knew that she would weep again when she saw the kind, tender hands folded in death; the face that had never looked save with love upon her, fixed and gray and dead. But she saw beyond that bitter moment a long procession of years to come that would belong to her absolutely. And she opened and spread her arms out to them in welcome.  There would be no one to live for her during those coming years; she would live for herself. There would be no powerful will bending hers in that blind persistence with which men and women believe they have a right to impose a private will upon a fellow- creature. A kind intention or a cruel intention made the act seem no less a crime as she looked upon it in that brief moment of illumination.  And yet she had loved him—sometimes. Often she had not. What did it matter! What could love, the unsolved mystery, count for in face of this possession of self-assertion which she suddenly recognized as the strongest impulse of her being!  “Free! Body and soul free!” she kept whispering.  Josephine was kneeling before the closed door with her lips to the keyhole, imploring for admission. “Louise, open the door! I beg; open the door—you will make yourself ill. What are you doing, Louise? For heaven’s sake open the door.”  “Go away. I am not making myself ill.” No; she was drinking in a very elixir of life through that open window.  Her fancy was running riot along those days ahead of her. Spring days, and summer days, and all sorts of days that would be her own. She breathed a quick prayer that life might be long. It was only yesterday she had thought with a shudder that life might be long.  She arose at length and opened the door to her sister’s importunities. There was a feverish triumph in her eyes, and she carried herself unwittingly like a goddess of Victory. She clasped her sister’s waist, and together they descended the stairs. Richards stood waiting for them at the bottom.  Some one was opening the front door with a latchkey. It was Brently Mallard who entered, a little travel-stained, composedly carrying his grip-sack and umbrella. He had been far from the scene of accident, and did not even know there had been one. He stood amazed at Josephine’s piercing cry; at Richards’ quick motion to screen him from the view of his wife.  But Richards was too late.  When the doctors came they said she had died of heart disease—of joy that kills.

But what are the traditional Saudi dishes like?     Saudi cuisine is strongly influenced by the kingdom's nomadic past. The Bedouin tribes were goat and sheep herders who relied on their livestock for meat, milk, and cheese. Traditional Saudi dishes are mostly based on meat, rice, and spices. The most common meat eaten is chicken; lamb is a common choice when entertaining honored guests, and camel is served on special occasions. According to Islamic law, the consumption of pork is prohibited, as is alcohol.     Traditional Saudi cuisine makes use of beans, wheat, rice, yogurt and of course dates. Saudis are self-sufficient in wheat production and export it to dozens of countries. The farmers also grow substantial amounts of barley, sorghum and millet. Flat breads, or tameez, similar to a pita, are inexpensive and used to scoop up their meals.     Most of the fruit and vegetables are imported but Saudis grow watermelon, citrus fruits, squash, tomatoes and onion. Spices such as cardamom, saffron, cumin, coriander, cinnamon and cloves are also prevalent in the traditional Saudi dishes.     Saudi Arabia has over 25 million date palms and dates are a staple food in the kingdom. Not only are they eaten on their own but dates are also a common ingredient in local dishes. Dates are important during Ramadan, when they are traditionally eaten every evening to break the fast.     Saudi meals start with gahwa, or coffee, and dates, followed by sweet tea. Only then is dinner served. After dinner, coffee, dates and finally sweet tea is served again. The entire meal takes hours and may last until the early hours of the morning.TRADITIONAL SAUDI DISHES- KABSA –  Kabsa is considered a national dish of Saudi Arabia, even though it is also enjoyed throughout the Arabian Peninsula, known as machboos.     The dish is similar to Persian and Indian biryanis—long-grain rice cooked in heavily spiced stock, topped with chicken, lamb, or camel meat. It can also be served with fish or shrimp.     Kabsa is served on a large platter, meant to be shared and eaten by hands (always a right hand).- JAREESH -
 Jareesh is crushed whole wheat cooked in milk and garnished with crispy cooked onions and lime.The dried limes are the secret ingredient in Saudi and Middle-Eastern cooking. These small dry balls can be dropped whole in a pot or pierced with a fork to get a few drops of juice out.  In the Middle East, these limes are most often added whole to soups and stews. They add a pleasant tang and a subtle complexity to the entire dish.- MATAZEEZ -  Matazeez is a rich stew of meat, vegetables, tomato sauce, and spices with whole-wheat dumplings cut into egg-sized piece, flattened, and then placed inside the pot.The most common meat is lamb and the dish can include a combination of vegetables such as carrots, onions, cauliflower, eggplant.The most common mix of spices is cumin, cinnamon and loomi (dried limes), cardamon, cloves, and nutmeg. The dish is similar to margoog but less soupy in consistency.- SALEEG -
Saleeg is a rice dish consisting of creamy short-grain rice topped with roasted meat. The rice is boiled in water and then combined with milk and ghee or butter, and cooked until it reaches the desired consistency.The dish is usually served on a large serving platter, tabasi, with a spicy, salsa-like salsa, lemon wedges, or a chopped tomato-cucumber-carrot salad.- EATING SAUDI STYLE -     Every gathering starts with gahwa and tea, both are always made in front of the dinner guests and it is impolite to refuse it. Most Saudi homes have a sitting room with carpets on the floor and cushions against the wall for social gatherings. There is usually a stove or fireplace to prepare the coffee and tea.Hands are washed before and after eating. In restaurants it is common to bring a wet napkin in the end of the meal. The tradition is to eat on the floor in a cross-legged position. Food platters are placed on a table cloth or a cover made of dried palm leaves. Saudis use their right hands to eat and keeping the left hand on the table is not acceptable, as is passing food with the left hand. Saudis are known for their generosity and food is abundant when entertaining guests. The dinner guests leave some foods on the plate indicating that the host has offered plenty of foods.In Riyadh, the best place to experience the traditional Saudi dishes is at Najd Village.​</a>

                            4. No student of a foreign language needs to be told that grammar is complex.

displaying emotions of happiness, anger, surprise, and
disgust, The birds learned to distinguish between these
expressions. Not only that, but they were also able to correctly
identify the same expressions on photographs of
unfamiliar faces. Their achievement does not suggest,
of course, that the pigeons had any idea what the human
expressions meant
Some psychologists have theorized that because of
the importance of facial expression to human
communication, humans developed special nervous systems
capable of recognizing subtle expressions. The pigeons cast
doubt on that idea, however,
In fact, the ability to recognize facial expressions of
emotion is not necessarily innate even in human babies, but
may have to be learned in much the same way pigeons
learn, in experiments conducted several years ago at
the University of Iowa, it was found that pigeons organize
images of things into the same logical categories that
humans do
None of this work would come as any surprise to
Charles Darwin, who long ago wrote about the continuity of
mental development from animals to humans,

                            6. CARILAH IDE" POKOK TEKS DI BAWAH INIPolitics in the age of media convergence differs from a few decades ago.Citizens now have more outlets in expressing their thought by utilizing social media and messaging apps to respond to the news and give unsolicited commentaries on the most-debated subject in political affairs.  The use of hashtags and memes are prevalent. The meme is described by the academic Limor Shifman as a digital and user-generated content comprising one or a combined element of multimedia items.The basic ingredients of meme could be a simple picture of renowned persons edited anonymously, often with a short text or conversation bubble. This ranges from the making of a picture of lawmakers, top politicians, ministers or presidents, featuring their unique and signature facial expressions which are digitally edited and cluttered with funny or satirical message to a short clip, whose dubbing and subtitles are altered to serve a certain purpose.The meme circulating across social media timelines signifies public creativity, resulting from cyber activism and increased voluntary engagement by citizens in the public narrative, thanks to the widespread ownership of handheld gadgets.Indonesian netizen’s eagerness in using social media reflects the nation’s culture of participation in the digital era. In early 2017, Twitter reported Indonesia was the fifth country of Twitter users, with some  4.1 billion tweets sent from the country. Both trends indicate a high degree of activity and intense flow of online (accessible) content which at any rates are searchable worldwide through tracking a line of hashtag.The apparent fondness of engaging in public debate and reacting to the political narrative via social media substantiates a premise that highly political matter is not only a theme of discussion raised by high-profile policy makers, but cascading down to everyday conversation among ordinary citizens.  This reality is nevertheless susceptible to the irresponsible and derogatory content attributable to meme’s anonymous nature.Some years ago,  ideas or aspirations were best presented by the pressure of interest groups, political parties or  fractions in the legislature largely due to their ingrained power in persuading and mobilizing the masses. With the advent of digital communication the origin of social change initially driven by ideas is no longer sourced from the formal, hierarchical and structured institution. Instead, internet has capacitated individuals to pitch their own opinion, initiate a movement, and land themselves in a circumstance equally influential to that of formal political forces.Internet memes feed the cyberspace with ideas, a subtle movement, and political campaign. Meme diffusion which  easily escalates from a content merely shared by an individual to an item rapidly consumed by masses, highlights an important feature of broad reachability and friendliness to all segments of society, which is essential for political framing. As noted by Shifman, memes encapsulate a pot of ideas, communicative technique, and textually powerful social interaction.The researchers Colin Lankshear and Michele Knobel take memes even more seriously; though meme’s coverage is at the micro level (individual-to-individual), its repercussion is larger than its scope of diffusion. It can shape mindsets, social behavior and attitudes of numerous social groups.Meme functions as a presenter of ideas that conceals or clearly pitches a subjective interest.Take a viral meme created on Susi Pudjiastuti, the popular Fisheries and Marine Affairs Minister. Her campaign on consuming fish for a healthy diet is made into a meme with a twist on her campaign against illegal fishing: “… anyone who doesn’t eat fish, I will sink them”. A jargon, tagline, motto, and a short quote on a picture sums up a key message  at the end.The underlying issue of market sustainability in fisheries is a complex process involving supply and demand balancing effort, national purchasing power, and maritime culture cultivation that entails problem solving. One solution is promoting fish consumption across the nation, also for the population’s health. Indeed, the promotion is at the heart of government’s interest, which received huge public response. Susi’s popularity appeared to increase; the meme seemed to have successfully helped the government policy in promoting fish consumption.Meme flourishes because it benefits from internet penetration and regular use of social networking sites: shareability and readability. Passing a meme to others is not burdensome. Meanwhile an immense degree of readability occurs when even the most digitally-illiterate people can still access the meaning ascribed to a meme. Both aspects have made meme popularly circulated amongst citizens.</h2><br />

                            13. Tips For Becoming An Engaged Listener  Focus fully on the speaker. You can’t listen in an engaged way if you’re constantly checking your phone or thinking about something else. You need to stay focused on the moment-to-moment experience in order to pick up the subtle nuances and important nonverbal cues in a conversation. If you find it hard to concentrate on some speakers, try repeating their words over in your head—it’ll reinforce their message and help you stay focused. Favor your right ear. As strange as it sounds, the left side of the brain contains the primary processing centers for both speech comprehension and emotions. Since the left side of the brain is connected to the right side of the body, favoring your right ear can help you better detect the emotional nuances of what someone is saying. Avoid interrupting or trying to redirect the conversation to your concerns. By saying something like, “If you think that’s bad, let me tell you what happened to me.” Listening is not the same as waiting for your turn to talk. You can’t concentrate on what someone’s saying if you’re forming what you’re going to say next. Often, the speaker can read your facial expressions and know that your mind’s elsewhere. Show your interest in what’s being said. Nod occasionally, smile at the person, and make sure your posture is open and inviting. Encourage the speaker to continue with small verbal comments like “yes” or “uh huh.” Try to set aside judgment. In order to communicate effectively with someone, you don’t have to like them or agree with their ideas, values, or opinions. However, you do need to set aside your judgment and withhold blame and criticism in order to fully understand them. The most difficult communication, when successfully executed, can often lead to an unlikely connection with someone.  Read the text above and analyze based on the questions.  1.

Anda perlu tetap fokus pada pengalaman dari waktu ke waktu untuk mengambil nuansa yang halus dan isyarat nonverbal yang penting dalam percakapan.

Carikan 20 kalimat PRESENT TENSE dalam teks ini!TASTE OF SAUDI ARABIA: TRADITIONAL SAUDI DISHES     Saudi Arabian grocery stores are well stocked with international foods, fast food is ubiquitous and very popular, and ethnic restaurants abound. But what are the traditional Saudi dishes like?     Saudi cuisine is strongly influenced by the kingdom's nomadic past. The Bedouin tribes were goat and sheep herders who relied on their livestock for meat, milk, and cheese. Traditional Saudi dishes are mostly based on meat, rice, and spices. The most common meat eaten is chicken; lamb is a common choice when entertaining honored guests, and camel is served on special occasions. According to Islamic law, the consumption of pork is prohibited, as is alcohol.     Traditional Saudi cuisine makes use of beans, wheat, rice, yogurt and of course dates. Saudis are self-sufficient in wheat production and export it to dozens of countries. The farmers also grow substantial amounts of barley, sorghum and millet. Flat breads, or tameez, similar to a pita, are inexpensive and used to scoop up their meals.     Most of the fruit and vegetables are imported but Saudis grow watermelon, citrus fruits, squash, tomatoes and onion. Spices such as cardamom, saffron, cumin, coriander, cinnamon and cloves are also prevalent in the traditional Saudi dishes.     Saudi Arabia has over 25 million date palms and dates are a staple food in the kingdom. Not only are they eaten on their own but dates are also a common ingredient in local dishes. Dates are important during Ramadan, when they are traditionally eaten every evening to break the fast.     Saudi meals start with gahwa, or coffee, and dates, followed by sweet tea. Only then is dinner served. After dinner, coffee, dates and finally sweet tea is served again. The entire meal takes hours and may last until the early hours of the morning.TRADITIONAL SAUDI DISHES- KABSA –  Kabsa is considered a national dish of Saudi Arabia, even though it is also enjoyed throughout the Arabian Peninsula, known as machboos.     The dish is similar to Persian and Indian biryanis—long-grain rice cooked in heavily spiced stock, topped with chicken, lamb, or camel meat. It can also be served with fish or shrimp.     Kabsa is served on a large platter, meant to be shared and eaten by hands (always a right hand).- JAREESH -
 Jareesh is crushed whole wheat cooked in milk and garnished with crispy cooked onions and lime.The dried limes are the secret ingredient in Saudi and Middle-Eastern cooking. These small dry balls can be dropped whole in a pot or pierced with a fork to get a few drops of juice out.  In the Middle East, these limes are most often added whole to soups and stews. They add a pleasant tang and a subtle complexity to the entire dish.- MATAZEEZ -  Matazeez is a rich stew of meat, vegetables, tomato sauce, and spices with whole-wheat dumplings cut into egg-sized piece, flattened, and then placed inside the pot.The most common meat is lamb and the dish can include a combination of vegetables such as carrots, onions, cauliflower, eggplant.The most common mix of spices is cumin, cinnamon and loomi (dried limes), cardamon, cloves, and nutmeg. The dish is similar to margoog but less soupy in consistency.- SALEEG -
Saleeg is a rice dish consisting of creamy short-grain rice topped with roasted meat. The rice is boiled in water and then combined with milk and ghee or butter, and cooked until it reaches the desired consistency.The dish is usually served on a large serving platter, tabasi, with a spicy, salsa-like salsa, lemon wedges, or a chopped tomato-cucumber-carrot salad.- EATING SAUDI STYLE -     Every gathering starts with gahwa and tea, both are always made in front of the dinner guests and it is impolite to refuse it. Most Saudi homes have a sitting room with carpets on the floor and cushions against the wall for social gatherings. There is usually a stove or fireplace to prepare the coffee and tea.Hands are washed before and after eating. In restaurants it is common to bring a wet napkin in the end of the meal. The tradition is to eat on the floor in a cross-legged position. Food platters are placed on a table cloth or a cover made of dried palm leaves. Saudis use their right hands to eat and keeping the left hand on the table is not acceptable, as is passing food with the left hand.

                            21. Terjemahin dong kak :)For 2.5 million years the Earth climate has fluctuated, cycling from ice ages to warmer periods.But in the last century, the planet temperature has risen unusually fastabout 1.2 to 1.4 degrees Fahrenheit.Scientists believe it’s human activity that's driving the temperatures up,a process known as global warming.Ever since the industrial revolution began, factories, power plants and eventually cars have burnt fossil fuels such as oil and coal, releasing huge amounts of carbon dioxide and other gases into the atmosphere.These greenhouse gases trap heat near the earth in a naturally occurring process called the greenhouse effect.The greenhouse effect begins with the sun and the energy it radiates to the Earth.The Earth and the atmosphere absorb some of this energy while the rest is radiated back into space.Naturally occurring gases in the atmosphere trap some of this energy and reflect it back, warming the Earth. Scientists now believe that the greenhouse effect is being intensified by the extra greenhouse gases that humans have released.Evidence for global warming includes a recent string of very warm years.Scientists report that 1998 was the warmest year in measured history with 2005 coming in second, meanwhile readings taken from ice coresshow that the greenhouse gases, carbon dioxide and methane have hit their highest levels in the past 420 000 years.Arctic sea ice is also shrinking. According to NASA studies the extent of arctic sea ice has declined about 10% in the last thirty years.As long as industrialized nations consume energy and developing countries increase their fossil fuel consumption, the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere will continue to rise.Researchers predict that temperatures will increase about two to ten degrees Fahrenheit by the end of the century.What’s less certain is what rising temperatures mean for the planet.Some climate models predict subtle changes, others forecast rising sea levels which could flood coastal areas around the world.Weather patterns could change, making hurricanes more frequent.Severe droughts could become more common in warm areas and species unable to adapt to changing conditions would face extinction.Although much remains to be learned about global warming, many organizations advocate cutting greenhouse gas emissions to reduce theimpact of global warming.Consumers can help by saving energy around the house, switching to compact fluorescent light bulbs and driving fewer miles in their cars each week.These simple changes may help keep the Earth cooler in the future.​</h2><br />

SECTION 1 Reading ComprehensionDirection: On this part you will read some passages that completed by questions and answers (A, B, C, D) choose the best answer based on the question on your answer sheet followed by the explanation of the answer chosen! Question 1-11 There are two basic types of glaciers, those that ﬂow outward in all directions with little regard for any underlying terrain and those that are conﬁned by terrain to a particular path.  The ﬁrst category of glaciers includes those massive blankets that cover whole continents, appropriately called ice sheets. There must be over 50,000 square kilometers of land covered with ice for the glacier to qualify as an ice sheet. When portions of an ice sheet spread out over the ocean, they form ice shelves.  About 20,000 years ago the Cordilleran Ice Sheet covered nearly all the mountains in southern Alaska, western Canada, and the western United States. It was about 3 kilometers deep at its thickest point in northern Alberta. Now there are only two sheets left on Earth, those covering Greenland and Antarctica.  Any domelike body of ice that also ﬂows out in all directions but covers less than 50,000 square kilometers is called an ice cap. Although ice caps are rare nowadays, there are a number in northeastern Canada, on Baﬃn Island, and on the Queen Elizabeth Islands. The second category of glaciers includes those of a variety of shapes and sizes generally called mountain or alpine glaciers. Mountain glaciers are typically identiﬁed by the landform that controls their ﬂow. One form of mountain glacier that resembles an ice cap in that it ﬂows outward in several directions is called an ice ﬁeld. The difference between an ice ﬁeld and an ice cap is subtle. Essentially, the ﬂow of an ice ﬁeld is somewhat controlled by surrounding terrain and thus does not have the domelike shape of a cap. There are several ice ﬁelds in the Wrangell. St. Elias, and Chugach mountains of Alaska and northern British Columbia.  Less spectacular than large ice ﬁelds are the most common types of mountain glaciers: the cirque and valley glaciers. Cirque glaciers are found in depressions in the surface of the land and have a characteristic circular shape. The ice of valley glaciers, bound by terrain, ﬂows down valleys, curves around their corners, and falls over cliffs.</h2><br />

                            25. I need help to summarize this passage. I give you 10 points if you could help meNo student of a foreign language needs to be told that grammar is complex.  By changing word sequences and by adding a range of auxiliary verbs and suffixes, we are able to communicate tiny variations in meaning.  We can turn a statement into a question, state whether an action has taken place or is soon to take place, and perform many other word tricks to convey subtle differences in meaning.  Nor is this complexity inherent to the English language.  All languages, even those of so-called 'primitive' tribes have clever grammatical components.  The Cherokee pronoun system, for example, can distinguish between 'you and I', 'several other people and I' and 'you, another person and I'.  In English, all these meanings are summed up in the one, crude pronoun 'we'.  Grammar is universal and plays a part in every language, no matter how widespread it is.  So the question which has baffled many linguists is - who created grammar? At first, it would appear that this question is impossible to answer.  To find out how grammar is created, someone needs to be present at the time of a language's creation, documenting its emergence.  Many historical linguists are able to trace modern complex languages back to earlier languages, but in order to answer the question of how complex languages are actually formed, the researcher needs to observe how languages are started from scratch.  Amazingly, however, this is possible.Some of the most recent languages evolved due to the Atlantic slave trade.  At that time, slaves from a number of different ethnicities were forced to work together under colonizer's rule.  Since they had no opportunity to learn each other's languages, they developed a make-shift language called a pidgin.  Pidgins are strings of words copied from the language of the landowner.  They have little in the way of grammar, and in many cases it is difficult for a listener to deduce when an event happened, and who did what to whom. Speakers need to use circumlocution in order to make their meaning understood. Interestingly, however, all it takes for a pidgin to become a complex language is for a group of children to be exposed to it at the time when they learn their mother tongue. Slave children did not simply copy the strings of words uttered by their elders, they adapted their words to create a new, expressive language. Complex grammar systems which emerge from pidgins are termed creoles, and they are invented by children.Further evidence of this can be seen in studying sign languages for the deaf.  Sign languages are not simply a series of gestures; they utilize the same grammatical machinery that is found in spoken languages.  Moreover, there are many different languages used worldwide. The creation of one such language was documented quite recently in Nicaragua. Previously, all deaf people were isolated from each other, but in 1979 a new government introduced schools for the deaf.  Although children were taught speech and lip reading in the classroom, in the playgrounds they began to invent their own sign system, using the gestures that they used at home.  It was basically a pidgin.  Each child used the signs differently, and there was no consistent grammar.  However, children who joined the school later, when this inventive sign system was already around, developed a quite different sign language.  Although it was based on the signs of the older children, the younger children's language was more fluid and compact, and it utilised a large range of grammatical devices to clarify meaning.  What is more, all the children used the signs in the same way.  A new creole was born. Some linguists believe that many of the world's most established languages were creoles at first.  The English past tense –ed ending may have evolved from the verb 'do'.  'It ended' may once have been 'It end-did'.  Therefore it would appear that even the most widespread languages were partly created by children.  Children appear to have innate grammatical machinery in their brains, which springs to life when they are first trying to make sense of the world around them.  Their minds can serve to create logical, complex structures, even when there is no grammar present for them to copy.</h2><br />
                        <p>The summary may be:</p><p>Grammar is universal and plays a part in every language. What baffled many linguists is who created this elaborate grammar. Many historical linguists are able to trace the contents of the originally formed language, researchers need to observe how the language started from the beginning.
 Some of the latest languages ​​evolved due to Atlantic slave trade where the complex grammar systems that emerge from pidgins are called creoles, and they are created by children. Some linguists believe that many of the world's most established languages ​​are creoles at first. It will therefore appear that even the most extensive language is partly created by children. Children seem to have innate grammar machines in their brains. Their minds can function to create a logical and complex structure, even when no grammar is available for them to copy.</p><br /><p>Just shorten it if it's necessary.

                            29. There stood, facing the open window, a comfortable, roomy armchair. Into this she sank, pressed down by a physical exhaustion that haunted her body and seemed to reach into her soul.  She could see in the open square before her house the tops of trees that were all aquiver with the new spring life. The delicious breath of rain was in the air. In the street below a peddler was crying his wares. The notes of a distant song which some one was singing reached her faintly, and countless sparrows were twittering in the eaves.  There were patches of blue sky showing here and there through the clouds that had met and piled one above the other in the west facing her window.  She sat with her head thrown back upon the cushion of the chair, quite motionless, except when a sob came up into her throat and shook her, as a child who has cried itself to sleep continues to sob in its dreams.  She was young, with a fair, calm face, whose lines bespoke repression and even a certain strength. But now there was a dull stare in her eyes, whose gaze was fixed away off yonder on one of those patches of blue sky. It was not a glance of reflection, but rather indicated a suspension of intelligent thought.  There was something coming to her and she was waiting for it, fearfully. What was it? She did not know; it was too subtle and elusive to name. But she felt it, creeping out of the sky, reaching toward her through the sounds, the scents, the color that filled the air.  Now her bosom rose and fell tumultuously. She was beginning to recognize this thing that was approaching to possess her, and she was striving to beat it back with her will—as powerless as her two white slender hands would have been.  When she abandoned herself a little whispered word escaped her slightly parted lips. She said it over and over under her breath: “free, free, free!” The vacant stare and the look of terror that had followed it went from her eyes. They stayed keen and bright. Her pulses beat fast, and the coursing blood warmed and relaxed every inch of her body.  She did not stop to ask if it were or were not a monstrous joy that held her. A clear and exalted perception enabled her to dismiss the suggestion as trivial.  She knew that she would weep again when she saw the kind, tender hands folded in death; the face that had never looked save with love upon her, fixed and gray and dead. But she saw beyond that bitter moment a long procession of years to come that would belong to her absolutely. And she opened and spread her arms out to them in welcome.  There would be no one to live for her during those coming years; she would live for herself. There would be no powerful will bending hers in that blind persistence with which men and women believe they have a right to impose a private will upon a fellow- creature. A kind intention or a cruel intention made the act seem no less a crime as she looked upon it in that brief moment of illumination.  And yet she had loved him—sometimes. Often she had not. What did it matter! What could love, the unsolved mystery, count for in face of this possession of self-assertion which she suddenly recognized as the strongest impulse of her being!  “Free! Body and soul free!” she kept whispering.  Josephine was kneeling before the closed door with her lips to the keyhole, imploring for admission. “Louise, open the door! I beg; open the door—you will make yourself ill. What are you doing, Louise? For heaven’s sake open the door.”  “Go away. I am not making myself ill.” No; she was drinking in a very elixir of life through that open window.  Her fancy was running riot along those days ahead of her. Spring days, and summer days, and all sorts of days that would be her own. She breathed a quick prayer that life might be long. It was only yesterday she had thought with a shudder that life might be long.  She arose at length and opened the door to her sister’s importunities. There was a feverish triumph in her eyes, and she carried herself unwittingly like a goddess of Victory. She clasped her sister’s waist, and together they descended the stairs. Richards stood waiting for them at the bottom.  Some one was opening the front door with a latchkey. It was Brently Mallard who entered, a little travel-stained, composedly carrying his grip-sack and umbrella. He had been far from the scene of accident, and did not even know there had been one. He stood amazed at Josephine’s piercing cry; at Richards’ quick motion to screen him from the view of his wife.  But Richards was too late.  When the doctors came they said she had died of heart disease—of joy that kills.

But what are the traditional Saudi dishes like?     Saudi cuisine is strongly influenced by the kingdom's nomadic past. The Bedouin tribes were goat and sheep herders who relied on their livestock for meat, milk, and cheese. Traditional Saudi dishes are mostly based on meat, rice, and spices. The most common meat eaten is chicken; lamb is a common choice when entertaining honored guests, and camel is served on special occasions. According to Islamic law, the consumption of pork is prohibited, as is alcohol.     Traditional Saudi cuisine makes use of beans, wheat, rice, yogurt and of course dates. Saudis are self-sufficient in wheat production and export it to dozens of countries. The farmers also grow substantial amounts of barley, sorghum and millet. Flat breads, or tameez, similar to a pita, are inexpensive and used to scoop up their meals.     Most of the fruit and vegetables are imported but Saudis grow watermelon, citrus fruits, squash, tomatoes and onion. Spices such as cardamom, saffron, cumin, coriander, cinnamon and cloves are also prevalent in the traditional Saudi dishes.     Saudi Arabia has over 25 million date palms and dates are a staple food in the kingdom. Not only are they eaten on their own but dates are also a common ingredient in local dishes. Dates are important during Ramadan, when they are traditionally eaten every evening to break the fast.     Saudi meals start with gahwa, or coffee, and dates, followed by sweet tea. Only then is dinner served. After dinner, coffee, dates and finally sweet tea is served again. The entire meal takes hours and may last until the early hours of the morning.TRADITIONAL SAUDI DISHES- KABSA –  Kabsa is considered a national dish of Saudi Arabia, even though it is also enjoyed throughout the Arabian Peninsula, known as machboos.     The dish is similar to Persian and Indian biryanis—long-grain rice cooked in heavily spiced stock, topped with chicken, lamb, or camel meat. It can also be served with fish or shrimp.     Kabsa is served on a large platter, meant to be shared and eaten by hands (always a right hand).- JAREESH -
 Jareesh is crushed whole wheat cooked in milk and garnished with crispy cooked onions and lime.The dried limes are the secret ingredient in Saudi and Middle-Eastern cooking. These small dry balls can be dropped whole in a pot or pierced with a fork to get a few drops of juice out.  In the Middle East, these limes are most often added whole to soups and stews. They add a pleasant tang and a subtle complexity to the entire dish.- MATAZEEZ -  Matazeez is a rich stew of meat, vegetables, tomato sauce, and spices with whole-wheat dumplings cut into egg-sized piece, flattened, and then placed inside the pot.The most common meat is lamb and the dish can include a combination of vegetables such as carrots, onions, cauliflower, eggplant.The most common mix of spices is cumin, cinnamon and loomi (dried limes), cardamon, cloves, and nutmeg. The dish is similar to margoog but less soupy in consistency.- SALEEG -
Saleeg is a rice dish consisting of creamy short-grain rice topped with roasted meat. The rice is boiled in water and then combined with milk and ghee or butter, and cooked until it reaches the desired consistency.The dish is usually served on a large serving platter, tabasi, with a spicy, salsa-like salsa, lemon wedges, or a chopped tomato-cucumber-carrot salad.- EATING SAUDI STYLE -     Every gathering starts with gahwa and tea, both are always made in front of the dinner guests and it is impolite to refuse it. Most Saudi homes have a sitting room with carpets on the floor and cushions against the wall for social gatherings. There is usually a stove or fireplace to prepare the coffee and tea.Hands are washed before and after eating. In restaurants it is common to bring a wet napkin in the end of the meal. The tradition is to eat on the floor in a cross-legged position. Food platters are placed on a table cloth or a cover made of dried palm leaves. Saudis use their right hands to eat and keeping the left hand on the table is not acceptable, as is passing food with the left hand. Saudis are known for their generosity and food is abundant when entertaining guests. The dinner guests leave some foods on the plate indicating that the host has offered plenty of foods.In Riyadh, the best place to experience the traditional Saudi dishes is at Najd Village.​</h2><br />
